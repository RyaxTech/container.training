## About the slides

- The content of the training is based on the slides maintained by [Jérôme Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) and [multiple contributors](https://@@GITREPO@@/graphs/contributors) under [container.training](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training) to support workshops and tutorials for Containers and Kubernetes.

- We included exercises with as much information as possible in the slides. The goal is to try to execute the exercises during the training. In case some are skipped because of time constraints you are encouraged to complete them on your own.

- In case you have further questions you can search in the official Docker
 [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

- ... and looking for answers in sites such as [Docker forums](forums.docker.com) and
  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docker)
