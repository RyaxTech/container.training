# Kubernetes ecosystem


- Initially developed by Google

- It is currently maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

- The CNCF is a project of the Linux Fundation (but kubernetes can function on Windows and Mac!)

- Some representative members of the CNCF: Google, Twitter, Huawei, Intel, Cisco, IBM, Docker, Univa, VMware, Alibaba, jd.com, SAP, redhat, AT&T...

- CNCF delivers certifications, organises the "Kubecon" events, synchronizes developements, but mainly develops Kubernetes ecosystem


.debug[[common/cncf.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//common/cncf.md)]

## The different projects around Kubernetes

- Kubernetes is composed by a number of plugins and connected projects such as:
    - **Container Network Interface (CNI)**, defines a standard to manage the network.
    - **coreDNS**, server DNS for micro-services
    - **envoy**, a plugin CNI
    - **linkerd**, "service mesh" (load balancing, CNI, DNS, security, policy...)
    - **Vitess**, server SQL following a micro-services architecture

- CNCF tries to maintain a list of all the surrounding projects in *[landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/)*

# Kubernetes objects
--

- **Pods**
  - Represent a deployment unit composed by one or more tightly coupled containers sharing resources.
  - Containers within a Pod can communicate with each other through localhost.
  - All pods reside in a single flat, shared, network-address space, no NAT gateways exist between them. Pods access each other on their unique IP address. 
--

- **Controllers**
  - Create and manage multiple pods handling replication, rollout, self-healing.

---

## Pods and Containers 

- Ideally we should have one process per container. 

- If containers do not need to remain on the same node we would better put them on different pods.

## Kubernetes objects
--

- **Service**
  - Represent a single, constant point of entry to a group of pods providing the same service. Each service has an IP address and port that never change while the service exists.
--

- **Volumes**
  - Are directories accessible to the containers of a pod. Bound to pod lifecycle. 

--

- **Namespaces**
  - Provide an abstraction that enable the usage of multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster.
--

- **Nodes**
  - They can be VMs or physical machines, they provide the necessary services to run pods and are managed by the master components.

## Kubernetes architecture

--

- **Components communication and execution**
  - All components pass from API Server to communicate between them
  - Only kubelet runs as regular system component and can run the other components as pods
  - Components on worker nodes need to run on same node but components of master can be split across multiple nodes

--

- **Etcd**
  - Distributed, consistent key value store.
  - Only the API-Server talks with etcd directly. All other components talk to etcd indirectly through API-Server based on “Optimistic concurrency control”
  - Uses Raft consensus algorithm to decide on the actual state based on quorum (majority).

.debug[[kube/kubeobjects.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubeobjects.md)]
---

## Kubernetes architecture

--

- **API-Server**
  - It provides a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for querying and modifying the cluster state over a RESTful API. 
  - Performs authentication, authorization and admission control through different plugins before accessing state in etcd
  - Watch mechanism to inform clients for modifications on objects.

--

- **Controller manager**
  - It combines a multitude of controllers performing various reconciliation tasks.
  - Each controller watches the API server for changes to resources (Deployments, Services, and so on) and perform operations for each change
  - It reconciles the actual state with the desired state (specified in the resource’s spec section)
.debug[[kube/kubeobjects.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubeobjects.md)]
---


## Kubernetes architecture

--

- **Scheduler**
  - It updates pods definition and through the API-server watch mechanism the kubelet is notified to execute a pod.
  - The default scheduling algorithm determines acceptable nodes and selects the best one for the pod based on various configurable parameters.
  - Multiple schedulers can run simultaneously in the cluster and a pod can use whichever is more adapted.

# Exposing containers

- `kubectl expose` creates a *service* for existing pods

- A *service* is a stable address for a pod (or a bunch of pods)

- If we want to connect to our pod(s), we need to create a *service*

- Once a service is created, `kube-dns` will allow us to resolve it by name

  (i.e. after creating service `hello`, the name `hello` will resolve to something)

- There are different types of services, detailed on the following slides:

  `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, `ExternalName`

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Basic service types

- `ClusterIP` (default type)

  - a virtual IP address is allocated for the service (in an internal, private range)
  - this IP address is reachable only from within the cluster (nodes and pods)
  - our code can connect to the service using the original port number

- `NodePort`

  - a port is allocated for the service (by default, in the 30000-32768 range)
  - that port is made available *on all our nodes* and anybody can connect to it
  - our code must be changed to connect to that new port number

These service types are always available.

Under the hood: `kube-proxy` is using a userland proxy and a bunch of `iptables` rules.

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## More service types

- `LoadBalancer`

  - an external load balancer is allocated for the service
  - the load balancer is configured accordingly
    <br/>(e.g.: a `NodePort` service is created, and the load balancer sends traffic to that port)

- `ExternalName`

  - the DNS entry managed by `kube-dns` will just be a `CNAME` to a provided record
  - no port, no IP address, no nothing else is allocated

The `LoadBalancer` type is currently only available on AWS, Azure, and GCE.

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Running containers with open ports

- Since `ping` doesn't have anything to connect to, we'll have to run something else

.exercise[

- Start a bunch of ElasticSearch containers:
  ```bash
  kubectl run elastic --image=elasticsearch:2 --replicas=7
  ```

- Watch them being started:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

<!-- ```keys ^C``` -->

]

The `-w` option "watches" events happening on the specified resources.

Note: please DO NOT call the service `search`. It would collide with the TLD.

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Exposing our deployment

- We'll create a default `ClusterIP` service

.exercise[

- Expose the ElasticSearch HTTP API port:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deploy/elastic --port 9200
  ```

- Look up which IP address was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Services are layer 4 constructs

- You can assign IP addresses to services, but they are still *layer 4*

  (i.e. a service is not an IP address; it's an IP address + protocol + port)

- This is caused by the current implementation of `kube-proxy`

  (it relies on mechanisms that don't support layer 3)

- As a result: you *have to* indicate the port number for your service
    
- Running services with arbitrary port (or port ranges) requires hacks

  (e.g. host networking mode)

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Testing our service

- We will now send a few HTTP requests to our ElasticSearch pods

.exercise[

- Let's obtain the IP address that was allocated for our service, *programatically:*
  ```bash
  IP=$(kubectl get svc elastic -o go-template --template '{{ .spec.clusterIP }}')
  ```

- Send a few requests:
  ```bash
  curl http://$IP:9200/
  ```

]

--

We may see `curl: (7) Failed to connect to _IP_ port 9200: Connection refused`.

This is normal while the service starts up.

--

Once it's running, our requests are load balanced across multiple pods.

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## If we don't need a load balancer

- Sometimes, we want to access our scaled services directly:

  - if we want to save a tiny little bit of latency (typically less than 1ms)

  - if we need to connect over arbitrary ports (instead of a few fixed ones)

  - if we need to communicate over another protocol than UDP or TCP

  - if we want to decide how to balance the requests client-side

  - ...

- In that case, we can use a "headless service"

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Headless services

- A headless service is obtained by setting the `clusterIP` field to `None`

  (Either with `--cluster-ip=None`, or by providing a custom YAML)

- As a result, the service doesn't have a virtual IP address

- Since there is no virtual IP address, there is no load balancer either

- `kube-dns` will return the pods' IP addresses as multiple `A` records

- This gives us an easy way to discover all the replicas for a deployment

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Services and endpoints

- A service has a number of "endpoints"

- Each endpoint is a host + port where the service is available

- The endpoints are maintained and updated automatically by Kubernetes

.exercise[

- Check the endpoints that Kubernetes has associated with our `elastic` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service elastic
  ```

]

In the output, there will be a line starting with `Endpoints:`.

That line will list a bunch of addresses in `host:port` format.

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Viewing endpoint details

- When we have many endpoints, our display commands truncate the list
  ```bash
  kubectl get endpoints
  ```

- If we want to see the full list, we can use one of the following commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe endpoints elastic
  kubectl get endpoints elastic -o yaml
  ```

- These commands will show us a list of IP addresses

- These IP addresses should match the addresses of the corresponding pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l run=elastic -o wide
  ```

.debug[[kube/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## `endpoints` not `endpoint`

- `endpoints` is the only resource that cannot be singular

```bash
$ kubectl get endpoint
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "endpoint"
```

- This is because the type itself is plural (unlike every other resource)

- There is no `endpoint` object: `type Endpoints struct`

- The type doesn't represent a single endpoint, but a list of endpoints

## Reset

- Once you have finished playing with this deployment:

```bash
kubectl delete deployments elastic
```
- To go even further:
  - The [concept](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) of services from the official documentation
  - [DNS for services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/)

Our app on Kube

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## What's on the menu?

In this part, we will:

- **build** images for our app,

- **ship** these images with a registry,

- **run** deployments using these images,

- expose these deployments so they can communicate with each other,

- expose the web UI so we can access it from outside.

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## The plan

- Build on our control node (`node1`)

- Tag images so that they are named `$REGISTRY/servicename`

- Upload them to a registry

- Create deployments using the images

- Expose (with a ClusterIP) the services that need to communicate

- Expose (with a NodePort) the WebUI

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Which registry do we want to use?

- We could use the Docker Hub

- Or a service offered by our cloud provider (ACR, GCR, ECR...)

- Or we could just self-host that registry

*We'll self-host the registry because it's the most generic solution for this workshop.*

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Using the open source registry

- We need to run a `registry:2` container
  <br/>(make sure you specify tag `:2` to run the new version!)

- It will store images and layers to the local filesystem
  <br/>(but you can add a config file to use S3, Swift, etc.)

- Docker *requires* TLS when communicating with the registry

  - unless for registries on `127.0.0.0/8` (i.e. `localhost`)

  - or with the Engine flag `--insecure-registry`

- Our strategy: publish the registry container on a NodePort,
  <br/>so that it's available through `127.0.0.1:xxxxx` on each node

# Deploying a self-hosted registry

- We will deploy a registry container, and expose it with a NodePort

.exercise[

- Create the registry service:
  ```bash
  kubectl run registry --image=registry:2
  ```

- Expose it on a NodePort:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deploy/registry --port=5000 --type=NodePort
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Connecting to our registry

- We need to find out which port has been allocated

.exercise[

- View the service details:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe svc/registry
  ```

- Get the port number programmatically:
  ```bash
  NODEPORT=$(kubectl get svc/registry -o json | jq .spec.ports[0].nodePort)
  REGISTRY=127.0.0.1:$NODEPORT
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Testing our registry

- A convenient Docker registry API route to remember is `/v2/_catalog`

.exercise[

- View the repositories currently held in our registry:
  ```bash
  curl $REGISTRY/v2/_catalog
  ```

]

--

We should see:
```json
{"repositories":[]}
```

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Testing our local registry

- We can retag a small image, and push it to the registry

.exercise[

- Make sure we have the busybox image, and retag it:
  ```bash
  docker pull busybox
  docker tag busybox $REGISTRY/busybox
  ```

- Push it:
  ```bash
  docker push $REGISTRY/busybox
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Checking again what's on our local registry

- Let's use the same endpoint as before

.exercise[

- Ensure that our busybox image is now in the local registry:
  ```bash
  curl $REGISTRY/v2/_catalog
  ```

]

The curl command should now output:
```json
{"repositories":["busybox"]}
```

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Building and pushing our images

- We are going to use a convenient feature of Docker Compose

.exercise[

- Go to the `stacks` directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/stacks
  ```

- Build and push the images:
  ```bash
  export REGISTRY
  export TAG=v0.1
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml build
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml push
  ```

]

Let's have a look at the `dockercoins.yml` file while this is building and pushing.

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]

## Avoiding the `latest` tag

.warning[Make sure that you've set the `TAG` variable properly!]

- If you don't, the tag will default to `latest`

- The problem with `latest`: nobody knows what it points to!

  - the latest commit in the repo?

  - the latest commit in some branch? (Which one?)

  - the latest tag?

  - some random version pushed by a random team member?

- If you keep pushing the `latest` tag, how do you roll back?

- Image tags should be meaningful, i.e. correspond to code branches, tags, or hashes

## Deploying all the things

- We can now deploy our code (as well as a redis instance)

.exercise[

- Deploy `redis`:
  ```bash
  kubectl run redis --image=redis
  ```

- Deploy everything else:
  ```bash
    for SERVICE in hasher rng webui worker; do
      kubectl run $SERVICE --image=$REGISTRY/$SERVICE:$TAG
    done
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Is this working?

- After waiting for the deployment to complete, let's look at the logs!

  (Hint: use `kubectl get deploy -w` to watch deployment events)

.exercise[

- Look at some logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/rng
  kubectl logs deploy/worker
  ```

]

--

🤔 `rng` is fine ... But not `worker`.

--

💡 Oh right! We forgot to `expose`.

# Exposing services internally

- Three deployments need to be reachable by others: `hasher`, `redis`, `rng`

- `worker` doesn't need to be exposed

- `webui` will be dealt with later

.exercise[

- Expose each deployment, specifying the right port:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment redis --port 6379
  kubectl expose deployment rng --port 80
  kubectl expose deployment hasher --port 80
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Is this working yet?

- The `worker` has an infinite loop, that retries 10 seconds after an error

.exercise[

- Stream the worker's logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/worker --follow
  ```

  (Give it about 10 seconds to recover)

<!--
```keys
^C
```
-->

]

--

We should now see the `worker`, well, working happily.

# Exposing services for external access

- Now we would like to access the Web UI

- We will expose it with a `NodePort`

  (just like we did for the registry)

.exercise[

- Create a `NodePort` service for the Web UI:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deploy/webui --type=NodePort --port=80
  ```

- Check the port that was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc
  ```

]

## Accessing the web UI

- We can now connect to *any node*, on the allocated node port, to view the web UI

.exercise[

- Open the web UI in your browser (http://node-ip-address:3xxxx/)

<!-- ```open http://node1:3xxxx/``` -->

]

--

*Alright, we're back to where we started, when we were running on a single node!*

## To go even further

- Use a private or public [registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/).

- [Connect services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/connect-applications-service/).

# Daemon sets

- We want to scale `rng` in a way that is different from how we scaled `worker`

- We want one (and exactly one) instance of `rng` per node

- What if we just scale up `deploy/rng` to the number of nodes?

  - nothing guarantees that the `rng` containers will be distributed evenly

  - if we add nodes later, they will not automatically run a copy of `rng`

  - if we remove (or reboot) a node, one `rng` container will restart elsewhere

- Instead of a `deployment`, we will use a `daemonset`

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Daemon sets in practice

- Daemon sets are great for cluster-wide, per-node processes:

  - `kube-proxy`

  - `weave` (our overlay network)

  - monitoring agents

  - hardware management tools (e.g. SCSI/FC HBA agents)

  - etc.

- They can also be restricted to run [only on some nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#running-pods-on-only-some-nodes)

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Creating a daemon set

- Unfortunately, as of Kubernetes 1.10, the CLI cannot create daemon sets

--

- More precisely: it doesn't have a subcommand to create a daemon set

--

- But any kind of resource can always be created by providing a YAML description:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f foo.yaml
  ```

--

- How do we create the YAML file for our daemon set?

--

  - option 1: [read the docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#create-a-daemonset)

--

  - option 2: `vi` our way out of it

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Creating the YAML file for our daemon set

- Let's start with the YAML file for the current `rng` resource

.exercise[

- Dump the `rng` resource in YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl get deploy/rng -o yaml --export >rng.yml 
  ```

- Edit `rng.yml`

]

Note: `--export` will remove "cluster-specific" information, i.e.:
- namespace (so that the resource is not tied to a specific namespace)
- status and creation timestamp (useless when creating a new resource)
- resourceVersion and uid (these would cause... *interesting* problems)

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## "Casting" a resource to another

- What if we just changed the `kind` field?

  (It can't be that easy, right?)

.exercise[

- Change `kind: Deployment` to `kind: DaemonSet`

- Save, quit

- Try to create our new resource:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rng.yml
  ```

]

--

We all knew this couldn't be that easy, right!

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Understanding the problem

- The core of the error is:
  ```
  error validating data:
  [ValidationError(DaemonSet.spec):
  unknown field "replicas" in io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.DaemonSetSpec,
  ...
  ```

--

- *Obviously,* it doesn't make sense to specify a number of replicas for a daemon set

--

- Workaround: fix the YAML

  - remove the `replicas` field
  - remove the `strategy` field (which defines the rollout mechanism for a deployment)
  - remove the `status: {}` line at the end

--

- Or, we could also ...

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Use the `--force`, Luke

- We could also tell Kubernetes to ignore these errors and try anyway

- The `--force` flag's actual name is `--validate=false`

.exercise[

- Try to load our YAML file and ignore errors:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rng.yml --validate=false
  ```

]

--

🎩✨🐇

--

Wait ... Now, can it be *that* easy?

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

- Did we transform our `deployment` into a `daemonset`?

.exercise[

- Look at the resources that we have now:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

--

We have two resources called `rng`:

- the *deployment* that was existing before

- the *daemon set* that we just created

We also have one too many pods.
<br/>
(The pod corresponding to the *deployment* still exists.)

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## `deploy/rng` and `ds/rng`

- You can have different resource types with the same name

  (i.e. a *deployment* and a *daemon set* both named `rng`)

- We still have the old `rng` *deployment*

  ```
NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/rng        1         1         1            1           18m
  ```

- But now we have the new `rng` *daemon set* as well

  ```
NAME                DESIRED  CURRENT  READY  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE  NODE SELECTOR  AGE
daemonset.apps/rng  2        2        2      2           2          <none>         9s
  ```

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Too many pods

- If we check with `kubectl get pods`, we see:

  - *one pod* for the deployment (named `rng-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`)

  - *one pod per node* for the daemon set (named `rng-zzzzz`)

  ```
  NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  rng-54f57d4d49-7pt82        1/1       Running   0          11m
  rng-b85tm                   1/1       Running   0          25s
  rng-hfbrr                   1/1       Running   0          25s
  [...]
  ```

--

The daemon set created one pod per node, except on the master node.

The master node has [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) preventing pods from running there.

(To schedule a pod on this node anyway, the pod will require appropriate [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/).)

.footnote[(Off by one? We don't run these pods on the node hosting the control plane.)]

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## What are all these pods doing?

- Let's check the logs of all these `rng` pods

- All these pods have a `run=rng` label:

  - the first pod, because that's what `kubectl run` does
  - the other ones (in the daemon set), because we
    *copied the spec from the first one*

- Therefore, we can query everybody's logs using that `run=rng` selector

.exercise[

- Check the logs of all the pods having a label `run=rng`:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l run=rng --tail 1
  ```

]

--

It appears that *all the pods* are serving requests at the moment.

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## The magic of selectors

- The `rng` *service* is load balancing requests to a set of pods

- This set of pods is defined as "pods having the label `run=rng`"

.exercise[

- Check the *selector* in the `rng` service definition:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service rng
  ```

]

When we created additional pods with this label, they were
automatically detected by `svc/rng` and added as *endpoints*
to the associated load balancer.

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Removing the first pod from the load balancer

- What would happen if we removed that pod, with `kubectl delete pod ...`?

--

  The `replicaset` would re-create it immediately.

--

- What would happen if we removed the `run=rng` label from that pod?

--

  The `replicaset` would re-create it immediately.

--

  ... Because what matters to the `replicaset` is the number of pods *matching that selector.*

--

- But but but ... Don't we have more than one pod with `run=rng` now?

--

  The answer lies in the exact selector used by the `replicaset` ...

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Deep dive into selectors

- Let's look at the selectors for the `rng` *deployment* and the associated *replica set*

.exercise[

- Show detailed information about the `rng` deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe deploy rng
  ```

- Show detailed information about the `rng` replica:
  <br/>(The second command doesn't require you to get the exact name of the replica set)
  ```bash
  kubectl describe rs rng-yyyy
  kubectl describe rs -l run=rng
  ```

]

--

The replica set selector also has a `pod-template-hash`, unlike the pods in our daemon set.

# Updating a service through labels and selectors

- What if we want to drop the `rng` deployment from the load balancer?

- Option 1: 

  - destroy it

- Option 2: 

  - add an extra *label* to the daemon set

  - update the service *selector* to refer to that *label*

--

Of course, option 2 offers more learning opportunities. Right?

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Add an extra label to the daemon set

- We will update the daemon set "spec"

- Option 1:

  - edit the `rng.yml` file that we used earlier

  - load the new definition with `kubectl apply`

- Option 2: 

  - use `kubectl edit`

--

*If you feel like you got this💕🌈, feel free to try directly.*

*We've included a few hints on the next slides for your convenience!*

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## We've put resources in your resources

- Reminder: a daemon set is a resource that creates more resources!

- There is a difference between:

  - the label(s) of a resource (in the `metadata` block in the beginning)

  - the selector of a resource (in the `spec` block)

  - the label(s) of the resource(s) created by the first resource (in the `template` block)

- You need to update the selector and the template (metadata labels are not mandatory)

- The template must match the selector

  (i.e. the resource will refuse to create resources that it will not select)

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Adding our label

- Let's add a label `isactive: yes`

- In YAML, `yes` should be quoted; i.e. `isactive: "yes"`

.exercise[

- Update the daemon set to add `isactive: "yes"` to the selector and template label:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit daemonset rng
  ```

- Update the service to add `isactive: "yes"` to its selector:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit service rng
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

.exercise[

- Check the most recent log line of all `run=rng` pods to confirm that exactly one per node is now active:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l run=rng --tail 1
  ```

]

The timestamps should give us a hint about how many pods are currently receiving traffic.

.exercise[

- Look at the pods that we have right now:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Cleaning up

- The pods of the deployment and the "old" daemon set are still running

- We are going to identify them programmatically

.exercise[

- List the pods with `run=rng` but without `isactive=yes`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l run=rng,isactive!=yes
  ```

- Remove these pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pods -l run=rng,isactive!=yes
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Cleaning up stale pods

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                        READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
rng-54f57d4d49-7pt82        1/1       Terminating   0          51m
rng-54f57d4d49-vgz9h        1/1       Running       0          22s
rng-b85tm                   1/1       Terminating   0          39m
rng-hfbrr                   1/1       Terminating   0          39m
rng-vplmj                   1/1       Running       0          7m
rng-xbpvg                   1/1       Running       0          7m
[...]
```

- The extra pods (noted `Terminating` above) are going away

- ... But a new one (`rng-54f57d4d49-vgz9h` above) was restarted immediately!

--

- Remember, the *deployment* still exists, and makes sure that one pod is up and running

- If we delete the pod associated to the deployment, it is recreated automatically

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Deleting a deployment

.exercise[

- Remove the `rng` deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete deployment rng
  ```
]

--

- The pod that was created by the deployment is now being terminated:

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                        READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
rng-54f57d4d49-vgz9h        1/1       Terminating   0          4m
rng-vplmj                   1/1       Running       0          11m
rng-xbpvg                   1/1       Running       0          11m
[...]
```

Ding, dong, the deployment is dead! And the daemon set lives on.

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Avoiding extra pods

- When we changed the definition of the daemon set, it immediately created new pods. We had to remove the old ones manually.

- How could we have avoided this?

--

- By adding the `isactive: "yes"` label to the pods before changing the daemon set!

- This can be done programmatically with `kubectl patch`:

  ```bash
    PATCH='
    metadata:
      labels:
        isactive: "yes"
    '
    kubectl get pods -l run=rng -l controller-revision-hash -o name |
      xargs kubectl patch -p "$PATCH" 
  ```

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Labels and debugging

- When a pod is misbehaving, we can delete it: another one will be recreated

- But we can also change its labels

- It will be removed from the load balancer (it won't receive traffic anymore)

- Another pod will be recreated immediately

- But the problematic pod is still here, and we can inspect and debug it

- We can even re-add it to the rotation if necessary

  (Very useful to troubleshoot intermittent and elusive bugs)

.debug[[kube/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/daemonset.md)]
---

## Labels and advanced rollout control

- Conversely, we can add pods matching a service's selector

- These pods will then receive requests and serve traffic

- Examples:

  - one-shot pod with all debug flags enabled, to collect logs

  - pods created automatically, but added to rotation in a second step
    <br/>
    (by setting their label accordingly)

- This gives us building blocks for canary and blue/green deployments

## To go further

- Understand the concept of [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)

- Understand the [labels and selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/)

# Rolling updates

- By default (without rolling updates), when a scaled resource is updated:

  - new pods are created

  - old pods are terminated
  
  - ... all at the same time
  
  - if something goes wrong, ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling updates

- With rolling updates, when a resource is updated, it happens progressively

- Two parameters determine the pace of the rollout: `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge`

- They can be specified in absolute number of pods, or percentage of the `replicas` count

- At any given time ...

  - there will always be at least `replicas`-`maxUnavailable` pods available

  - there will never be more than `replicas`+`maxSurge` pods in total

  - there will therefore be up to `maxUnavailable`+`maxSurge` pods being updated

- We have the possibility to rollback to the previous version
  <br/>(if the update fails or is unsatisfactory in any way)

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

## Checking current rollout parameters

- Recall how we build custom reports with `kubectl` and `jq`:

.exercise[

- Show the rollout plan for our deployments:
  ```bash
    kubectl get deploy -o json |
            jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .spec.strategy.rollingUpdate"
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---


## Rolling updates in practice

- As of Kubernetes 1.8, we can do rolling updates with:

  `deployments`, `daemonsets`, `statefulsets`

- Editing one of these resources will automatically result in a rolling update

- Rolling updates can be monitored with the `kubectl rollout` subcommand

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

## Building a new version of the `worker` service

.exercise[

- Go to the `stack` directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/stacks
  ```

- Edit `dockercoins/worker/worker.py`, update the `sleep` line to sleep 1 second

- Build a new tag and push it to the registry:
  ```bash
  #export REGISTRY=localhost:3xxxx
  export TAG=v0.2
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml build
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml push
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling out the new `worker` service

.exercise[

- Let's monitor what's going on by opening a few terminals, and run:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  kubectl get replicasets -w
  kubectl get deployments -w
  ```

<!-- ```keys ^C``` -->

- Update `worker` either with `kubectl edit`, or by running:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deploy worker worker=$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG
  ```

]

--

That rollout should be pretty quick. What shows in the web UI?

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

## Give it some time

- At first, it looks like nothing is happening (the graph remains at the same level)

- According to `kubectl get deploy -w`, the `deployment` was updated really quickly

- But `kubectl get pods -w` tells a different story

- The old `pods` are still here, and they stay in `Terminating` state for a while

- Eventually, they are terminated; and then the graph decreases significantly

- This delay is due to the fact that our worker doesn't handle signals

- Kubernetes sends a "polite" shutdown request to the worker, which ignores it

- After a grace period, Kubernetes gets impatient and kills the container

  (The grace period is 30 seconds, but [can be changed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#termination-of-pods) if needed)

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling out a boo-boo

- What happens if we make a mistake?

.exercise[

- Update `worker` by specifying a non-existent image:
  ```bash
  export TAG=v0.3
  kubectl set image deploy worker worker=$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG
  ```

- Check what's going on:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout status deploy worker
  ```

]

--

Our rollout is stuck. However, the app is not dead (just 10% slower).

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

## What's going on with our rollout?

- Why is our app 10% slower?

- Because `MaxUnavailable=1`, so the rollout terminated 1 replica out of 10 available

- Okay, but why do we see 2 new replicas being rolled out?

- Because `MaxSurge=1`, so in addition to replacing the terminated one, the rollout is also starting one more

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The nitty-gritty details

- We start with 10 pods running for the `worker` deployment

- Current settings: MaxUnavailable=1 and MaxSurge=1

- When we start the rollout:

  - one replica is taken down (as per MaxUnavailable=1)
  - another is created (with the new version) to replace it
  - another is created (with the new version) per MaxSurge=1

- Now we have 9 replicas up and running, and 2 being deployed

- Our rollout is stuck at this point!

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

## Recovering from a bad rollout

- We could push some `v0.3` image

  (the pod retry logic will eventually catch it and the rollout will proceed)

- Or we could invoke a manual rollback

.exercise[

<!--
```keys
^C
```
-->

- Cancel the deployment and wait for the dust to settle down:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deploy worker
  kubectl rollout status deploy worker
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

## Changing rollout parameters

- We want to:

  - revert to `v0.1`
  - be conservative on availability (always have desired number of available workers)
  - be aggressive on rollout speed (update more than one pod at a time) 
  - give some time to our workers to "warm up" before starting more

The corresponding changes can be expressed in the following YAML snippet:

.small[
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: worker
        image: $REGISTRY/worker:v0.1
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 3
  minReadySeconds: 10
```
]

.debug[[kube/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/rollout.md)]
---

## Applying changes through a YAML patch

- We could use `kubectl edit deployment worker`

- But we could also use `kubectl patch` with the exact YAML shown before

.exercise[

.small[

- Apply all our changes and wait for them to take effect:
  ```bash
  kubectl patch deployment worker -p "
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: worker
            image: $REGISTRY/worker:v0.1
      strategy:
        rollingUpdate:
          maxUnavailable: 0
          maxSurge: 3
      minReadySeconds: 10
    "
  kubectl rollout status deployment worker
  kubectl get deploy -o json worker |
          jq "{name:.metadata.name} + .spec.strategy.rollingUpdate"
  ```
  ] 

]

# Accessing logs from the CLI

- The `kubectl logs` commands has limitations:

  - it cannot stream logs from multiple pods at a time

  - when showing logs from multiple pods, it mixes them all together

- We are going to see how to do it better

.debug[[kube/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Doing it manually

- We *could* (if we were so inclined), write a program or script that would:

  - take a selector as an argument

  - enumerate all pods matching that selector (with `kubectl get -l ...`)

  - fork one `kubectl logs --follow ...` command per container

  - annotate the logs (the output of each `kubectl logs ...` process) with their origin

  - preserve ordering by using `kubectl logs --timestamps ...` and merge the output

--

- We *could* do it, but thankfully, others did it for us already!

.debug[[kube/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Stern

[Stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern) is an open source project
by [Wercker](http://www.wercker.com/).

From the README:

*Stern allows you to tail multiple pods on Kubernetes and multiple containers within the pod. Each result is color coded for quicker debugging.*

*The query is a regular expression so the pod name can easily be filtered and you don't need to specify the exact id (for instance omitting the deployment id). If a pod is deleted it gets removed from tail and if a new pod is added it automatically gets tailed.*

Exactly what we need!

.debug[[kube/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Installing Stern

- For simplicity, let's just grab a binary release

.exercise[

- Download a binary release from GitHub:
  ```bash
  sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/stern \
       https://github.com/wercker/stern/releases/download/1.6.0/stern_linux_amd64
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/stern
  ```

]

These installation instructions will work on our clusters, since they are Linux amd64 VMs.

However, you will have to adapt them if you want to install Stern on your local machine.

.debug[[kube/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Using Stern

- There are two ways to specify the pods for which we want to see the logs:

  - `-l` followed by a selector expression (like with many `kubectl` commands)

  - with a "pod query", i.e. a regex used to match pod names

- These two ways can be combined if necessary

.exercise[

- View the logs for all the rng containers:
  ```bash
  stern rng
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Stern convenient options

- The `--tail N` flag shows the last `N` lines for each container

  (Instead of showing the logs since the creation of the container)

- The `-t` / `--timestamps` flag shows timestamps

- The `--all-namespaces` flag is self-explanatory

.exercise[

- View what's up with the `weave` system containers:
  ```bash
  stern --tail 1 --timestamps --all-namespaces weave
  ```
]

.debug[[kube/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Using Stern with a selector

- When specifying a selector, we can omit the value for a label

- This will match all objects having that label (regardless of the value)

- Everything created with `kubectl run` has a label `run`

- We can use that property to view the logs of all the pods created with `kubectl run`

.exercise[

- View the logs for all the things started with `kubectl run`:
  ```bash
  stern -l run
  ```

]

# Centralized logging

- Using `kubectl` or `stern` is simple; but it has drawbacks:

  - when a node goes down, its logs are not available anymore

  - we can only dump or stream logs; we want to search/index/count...

- We want to send all our logs to a single place

- We want to parse them (e.g. for HTTP logs) and index them

- We want a nice web dashboard

--

- We are going to deploy an EFK stack

.debug[[kube/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## What is EFK?

- EFK is three components:

  - ElasticSearch (to store and index log entries)

  - Fluentd (to get container logs, process them, and put them in ElasticSearch)

  - Kibana (to view/search log entries with a nice UI)

- The only component that we need to access from outside the cluster will be Kibana

.debug[[kube/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Deploying EFK on our cluster

- We are going to use a YAML file describing all the required resources

.exercise[

- Load the YAML file into our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://goo.gl/MUZhE4
  ```

]

If we [look at the YAML file](https://goo.gl/MUZhE4), we see that
it creates a daemon set, two deployments, two services,
and a few roles and role bindings (to give fluentd the required permissions).

.debug[[kube/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## The itinerary of a log line (before Fluentd)

- A container writes a line on stdout or stderr

- Both are typically piped to the container engine (Docker or otherwise)

- The container engine reads the line, and sends it to a logging driver

- The timestamp and stream (stdout or stderr) is added to the log line

- With the default configuration for Kubernetes, the line is written to a JSON file

  (`/var/log/containers/pod-name_namespace_container-id.log`)

- That file is read when we invoke `kubectl logs`; we can access it directly too

.debug[[kube/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## The itinerary of a log line (with Fluentd)

- Fluentd runs on each node (thanks to a daemon set)

- It binds-mounts `/var/log/containers` from the host (to access these files)

- It continuously scans this directory for new files; reads them; parses them

- Each log line becomes a JSON object, fully annotated with extra information:
  <br/>container id, pod name, Kubernetes labels ...

- These JSON objects are stored in ElasticSearch

- ElasticSearch indexes the JSON objects

- We can access the logs through Kibana (and perform searches, counts, etc.)

.debug[[kube/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Accessing Kibana

- Kibana offers a web interface that is relatively straightforward

- Let's check it out!

.exercise[

- Check which `NodePort` was allocated to Kibana:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc kibana
  ```

- With our web browser, connect to Kibana

]

.debug[[kube/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Using Kibana

*Note: this is not a Kibana workshop! So this section is deliberately very terse.*

- The first time you connect to Kibana, you must "configure an index pattern"

- Just use the one that is suggested, `@timestamp`

- Then click "Discover" (in the top-left corner)

- You should see container logs

- Advice: in the left column, select a few fields to display, e.g.:

  `kubernetes.host`, `kubernetes.pod_name`, `stream`, `log`

.debug[[kube/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Caveat emptor

We are using EFK because it is relatively straightforward
to deploy on Kubernetes, without having to redeploy or reconfigure
our cluster. But it doesn't mean that it will always be the best
option for your use-case. If you are running Kubernetes in the
cloud, you might consider using the cloud provider's logging
infrastructure (if it can be integrated with Kubernetes).

The deployment method that we will use here has been simplified:
there is only one ElasticSearch node. In a real deployment, you
might use a cluster, both for performance and reliability reasons.
But this is outside of the scope of this chapter.

The YAML file that we used creates all the resources in the
`default` namespace, for simplicity. In a real scenario, you will
create the resources in the `kube-system` namespace or in a dedicated namespace.

# Managing stacks with Helm

- We created our first resources with `kubectl run`, `kubectl expose` ...

- We have also created resources by loading YAML files with `kubectl apply -f`

- For larger stacks, managing thousands of lines of YAML is unreasonable

- These YAML bundles need to be customized with variable parameters

  (E.g.: number of replicas, image version to use ...)

- It would be nice to have an organized, versioned collection of bundles

- It would be nice to be able to upgrade/rollback these bundles carefully

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is an open source project offering all these things!

.debug[[kube/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/helm.md)]
---

## Helm concepts

- `helm` is a CLI tool

- `tiller` is its companion server-side component

- A "chart" is an archive containing templatized YAML bundles

- Charts are versioned

- Charts can be stored on private or public repositories

.debug[[kube/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/helm.md)]
---

## Installing Helm

- We need to install the `helm` CLI; then use it to deploy `tiller`

.exercise[

- Install the `helm` CLI:
  ```bash
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get | bash
  ```

- Deploy `tiller`:
  ```bash
  helm init
  ```

- Add the `helm` completion:
  ```bash
  . <(helm completion $(basename $SHELL))
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/helm.md)]
---

## Fix account permissions

- Helm permission model requires us to tweak permissions

- In a more realistic deployment, you might create per-user or per-team
  service accounts, roles, and role bindings

.exercise[

- Grant `cluster-admin` role to `kube-system:default` service account:
  ```bash
  kubectl create clusterrolebinding add-on-cluster-admin \
      --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:default
  ```

]

(Defining the exact roles and permissions on your cluster requires
a deeper knowledge of Kubernetes' RBAC model. The command above is
fine for personal and development clusters.)

.debug[[kube/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/helm.md)]
---

## View available charts

- A public repo is pre-configured when installing Helm

- We can view available charts with `helm search` (and an optional keyword)

.exercise[

- View all available charts:
  ```bash
  helm search
  ```

- View charts related to `prometheus`:
  ```bash
  helm search prometheus
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/helm.md)]
---

## Install a chart

- Most charts use `LoadBalancer` service types by default

- Most charts require persistent volumes to store data

- We need to relax these requirements a bit

.exercise[

- Install the Prometheus metrics collector on our cluster:
  ```bash
  helm install stable/prometheus \
         --set server.service.type=NodePort \
         --set server.persistentVolume.enabled=false
  ```

]

Where do these `--set` options come from?

.debug[[kube/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/helm.md)]
---

## Inspecting a chart

- `helm inspect` shows details about a chart (including available options)

.exercise[

- See the metadata and all available options for `stable/prometheus`:
  ```bash
  helm inspect stable/prometheus
  ```

]

The chart's metadata includes an URL to the project's home page.

(Sometimes it conveniently points to the documentation for the chart.)

.debug[[kube/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/helm.md)]
---

## Creating a chart

- We are going to show a way to create a *very simplified* chart

- In a real chart, *lots of things* would be templatized

  (Resource names, service types, number of replicas...)

.exercise[

- Create a sample chart:
  ```bash
  helm create dockercoins
  ```

- Move away the sample templates and create an empty template directory:
  ```bash
  mv dockercoins/templates dockercoins/default-templates
  mkdir dockercoins/templates
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/helm.md)]
---

## Exporting the YAML for our application

- The following section assumes that DockerCoins is currently running

.exercise[

- Create one YAML file for each resource that we need:
  .small[
  ```bash

	while read kind name; do
	  kubectl get -o yaml --export $kind $name > dockercoins/templates/$name-$kind.yaml
	done <<EOF
	deployment worker
	deployment hasher
	daemonset rng
	deployment webui
	deployment redis
	service hasher
	service rng
	service webui
	service redis
	EOF
  ```
  ]

]

.debug[[kube/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/helm.md)]
---

## Testing our helm chart

.exercise[

- Let's install our helm chart! (`dockercoins` is the path to the chart)
  ```bash
  helm install dockercoins
  ```
]

--

- Since the application is already deployed, this will fail:<br>
`Error: release loitering-otter failed: services "hasher" already exists`

- To avoid naming conflicts, we will deploy the application in another *namespace*

.debug[[kube/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/helm.md)]

# Namespaces

- We cannot have two resources with the same name

  (Or can we...?)

--

- We cannot have two resources *of the same type* with the same name

  (But it's OK to have a `rng` service, a `rng` deployment, and a `rng` daemon set!)

--

- We cannot have two resources of the same type with the same name *in the same namespace*

  (But it's OK to have e.g. two `rng` services in different namespaces!)

--

- In other words: **the tuple *(type, name, namespace)* needs to be unique**

  (In the resource YAML, the type is called `Kind`)

.debug[[kube/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/namespaces.md)]
---

## Pre-existing namespaces

- If we deploy a cluster with `kubeadm`, we have three namespaces:

  - `default` (for our applications)

  - `kube-system` (for the control plane)

  - `kube-public` (contains one secret used for cluster discovery)

- If we deploy differently, we may have different namespaces

.debug[[kube/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/namespaces.md)]
---

## Creating namespaces

- We can create namespaces with a very minimal YAML, e.g.:
  ```bash
	kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Namespace
	metadata:
	  name: blue
	EOF
  ```

- If we are using a tool like Helm, it will create namespaces automatically

.debug[[kube/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/namespaces.md)]
---

## Using namespaces

- We can pass a `-n` or `--namespace` flag to most `kubectl` commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n blue get svc
  ```

- We can also use *contexts*

- A context is a *(user, cluster, namespace)* tuple

- We can manipulate contexts with the `kubectl config` command

.debug[[kube/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/namespaces.md)]
---

## Creating a context

- We are going to create a context for the `blue` namespace

.exercise[

- View existing contexts to see the cluster name and the current user:
  ```bash
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```

- Create a new context:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context blue --namespace=blue \
      --cluster=kubernetes --user=kubernetes-admin
  ```

]

We have created a context; but this is just some configuration values.

The namespace doesn't exist yet.

.debug[[kube/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/namespaces.md)]
---

## Using a context

- Let's switch to our new context and deploy the DockerCoins chart

.exercise[

- Use the `blue` context:
  ```bash
  kubectl config use-context blue
  ```

- Deploy DockerCoins:
  ```bash
  helm install dockercoins
  ```

]

In the last command line, `dockercoins` is just the local path where
we created our Helm chart before.

## Viewing the deployed app

- Let's see if our Helm chart worked correctly!

.exercise[

- Retrieve the port number allocated to the `webui` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc webui
  ```

- Point our browser to http://X.X.X.X:3xxxx

]

Note: it might take a minute or two for the app to be up and running.

## Namespaces and isolation

- Namespaces *do not* provide isolation

- A pod in the `green` namespace can communicate with a pod in the `blue` namespace

- A pod in the `default` namespace can communicate with a pod in the `kube-system` namespace

- `kube-dns` uses a different subdomain for each namespace

- Example: from any pod in the cluster, you can connect to the Kubernetes API with:

  `https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local:443/`

# Isolation and network policies

- Namespaces *do not* provide isolation

- A pod in the `green` namespace can communicate with a pod in the `blue` namespace

- A pod in the `default` namespace can communicate with a pod in the `kube-system` namespace

- `kube-dns` uses a different subdomain for each namespace

- Example: from any pod in the cluster, you can connect to the Kubernetes API with:

  `https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local:443/`

.debug[[kube/netisolation.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/netisolation.md)]

## Isolating pods

- Actual isolation is implemented with *network policies*

- Network policies are resources (like deployments, services, namespaces...)

- Network policies specify which flows are allowed:

  - between pods

  - from pods to the outside world

  - and vice-versa

(The CNI plugin has to support the *NetworkPolicy*)
.debug[[kube/netisolation.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/netisolation.md)]
---

## Network policies overview

- We can create as many network policies as we want

- Each network policy has:

  - a *pod selector*: "which pods are targeted by the policy?"

  - lists of ingress and/or egress rules: "which peers and ports are allowed or blocked?"

- If a pod is not targeted by any policy, traffic is allowed by default

- If a pod is targeted by at least one policy, traffic must be allowed explicitly

.debug[[kube/netisolation.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/netisolation.md)]
---

## Example of network policies

.exercise[

- Let's deploy a nginx.
  ```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --replicas=2
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80
  ```

- Let's see if everything has gone well
  ```bash
kubectl get svc,pod | grep nginx
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/netisolation.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/netisolation.md)]
---

## Example of network policies

.exercise[

- Let's test a service from a pod
  ```bash
kubectl run -i --tty interactivetest --image=alpine --restart=Never --rm -- sh
  ```
(this will start an interactive session where the keyboard inputs and terminal outputs are redirected for a pod called *interactivetest* that contains a container *alpine*, which will never be restarted, it will be deleted when the command is finished and which will start the command *sh*)

- Let's verify the acces to nginx:
  ```bash
wget -qO- nginx
  ```

]

.debug[[kube/netisolation.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/netisolation.md)]
---

## Let's block all traffic

.exercise[

- Create a yaml file that contains:
```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
        name: access-nginx
spec:
        podSelector:
                matchLabels:
                        run: nginx
        ingress:
        - from:
            - podSelector:
                matchLabels:
                    iamnice: yeah
```
- and now deploy it.

]

.debug[[kube/netisolation.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/netisolation.md)]
---

## Is all traffic blocked?

.exercise[

- Let's try to connect to nginx:

  ```bash
wget -qO- nginx
```

- The traffic should be blocked!

]
.debug[[kube/netisolation.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/gh-pages//kube/netisolation.md)]
---

## Block all traffic except *iamnice*

.exercise[

- Let's restart our test pod with the good labels (ctrl+d or exit to leave the previous one):

  ```bash
kubectl run -i --tty interactivetest --image=alpine --labels="iamnice=yeah" --restart=Never --rm -- sh
```

From this pod the acces should be allowed.
  ```bash
wget -qO- nginx
```

]

## Reset

Remove the service, the deployement and the network policy of this example.

## More about network policies

- We can also make *selectors* for the namespaces
    - very useful to block containers to acces the API of Kubernetes!

- We can block/authorize the communications towards/from particular ports

- Identically with IPs and blocks of IPs.

- For more details, check:

  - the [Kubernetes documentation about network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)

  - this [talk about network policies at KubeCon 2017 US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gGpMmYeEO8) by [@ahmetb](https://twitter.com/ahmetb)

  - and some [exercices](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes)
