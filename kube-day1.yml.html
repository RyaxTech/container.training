- Each person gets a private cluster of cloud VMs (not shared with anybody else)

- They'll remain up for the duration of the workshop

- You should have a little card with login+password+IP addresses

- You can automatically SSH from one VM to another

- The nodes have aliases: `node1`, `node2`, etc.

## Connecting to our lab environment

.exercise[

- Log into the first VM (`node1`) with your SSH client

- Check that you can SSH (without password) to `node2`:
  ```bash
  ssh node2
  ```
- Type `exit` or `^D` to come back to `node1`

]

If anything goes wrong — ask for help!

## We will (mostly) interact with node1 only

*These remarks apply only when using multiple nodes, of course.*

- Unless instructed, **all commands must be run from the first VM, `node1`**

- We will only checkout/copy the code on `node1`

- During normal operations, we do not need access to the other nodes

- If we had to troubleshoot issues, we would use a combination of:

  - SSH (to access system logs, daemon status...)
  
  - Docker API (to check running containers and container engine status)

# Kubernetes concepts

- Kubernetes is a container management system

- It runs and manages containerized applications on a cluster

--

- What does that really mean?

.debug[[kube/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Kubernetes Introduction

--

- It is a software to deploy and manage containerized applications while offering an optimal usage of the compute platform.

--

- It abstracts the underlying infrastructure by simplifying the development of applications and the management of resources.

.debug[[kube/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Kubernetes name

- How do we pronounce kubernetes?
    - The word comes from the greek work κυβερνήτης, pronounced "kivernitis" meaning the captain of a ship or plane
    - In english we say : "coubernetis"
    - In french : "cubernetesse" ou "cubernette"

- It is quite common to write Kubernetes as k8s or kube

.debug[[kube/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Kubernetes Benefits

--

- Simplify Application Deployment.

--

- Achieving better utilization of hardware.

--

- Automatic Scaling.

--

- Simplifying applications development

--

- High Availability, health check and self-healing

.debug[[kube/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/concepts-k8s.md)]
---



## Basic things we can ask Kubernetes to do

--

- Start 5 containers using image `atseashop/api:v1.3`

--

- Place an internal load balancer in front of these containers

--

- Start 10 containers using image `atseashop/webfront:v1.3`

--

- Place a public load balancer in front of these containers

--

- It's Christmas, traffic spikes, grow our cluster and add containers

--

- New release! Replace my containers with the new image `atseashop/webfront:v1.4`

--

- Keep processing requests during the upgrade; update my containers one at a time

.debug[[kube/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Other things that Kubernetes can do for us

- Basic autoscaling

- Blue/green deployment, canary deployment

- Long running services, but also batch (one-off) jobs

- Overcommit our cluster and *evict* low-priority jobs

- Run services with *stateful* data (databases etc.)

- Fine-grained access control defining *what* can be done by *whom* on *which* resources

- Integrating third party services (*service catalog*)

- Automating complex tasks (*operators*)

---

## Kubernetes architecture: the nodes

- The nodes executing our containers run a collection of services:

  - a container Engine (typically Docker)

  - kubelet (the "node agent")

  - kube-proxy (a necessary but not sufficient network component)

- Nodes were formerly called "minions"

  (You might see that word in older articles or documentation)

.debug[[kube/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Kubernetes architecture: the control plane

- The Kubernetes logic (its "brains") is a collection of services:

  - the API server (our point of entry to everything!)

  - core services like the scheduler and controller manager

  - `etcd` (a highly available key/value store; the "database" of Kubernetes)

- Together, these services form the control plane of our cluster

- The control plane is also called the "master"

.debug[[kube/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Running the control plane on special nodes

- It is common to reserve a dedicated node for the control plane

  (Except for single-node development clusters, like when using minikube)

- This node is then called a "master"

  (Yes, this is ambiguous: is the "master" a node, or the whole control plane?)

- Normal applications are restricted from running on this node

  (By using a mechanism called ["taints"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/))

- When high availability is required, each service of the control plane must be resilient

- The control plane is then replicated on multiple nodes

  (This is sometimes called a "multi-master" setup)

.debug[[kube/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Running the control plane outside containers

- The services of the control plane can run in or out of containers

- For instance: since `etcd` is a critical service, some people
  deploy it directly on a dedicated cluster (without containers)

  (This is illustrated on the first "super complicated" schema)

- In some hosted Kubernetes offerings (e.g. GKE), the control plane is invisible

  (We only "see" a Kubernetes API endpoint)

- In that case, there is no "master node"

*For this reason, it is more accurate to say "control plane" rather than "master".*

.debug[[kube/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Do we need to run Docker at all?

No!

--

- By default, Kubernetes uses the Docker Engine to run containers

- We could also use `rkt` ("Rocket") from CoreOS

- Or leverage other pluggable runtimes through the *Container Runtime Interface*

  (like CRI-O, or containerd)

.debug[[kube/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Do we need to run Docker at all?

Yes!

--

- In this workshop, we run our app on a single node first

- We will need to build images and ship them around

- We can do these things without Docker
  <br/>
  (and get diagnosed with NIH¹ syndrome)

- Docker is still the most stable container engine today
  <br/>
  (but other options are maturing very quickly)

---

## Do we need to run Docker at all?

- On our development environments, CI pipelines ... :

  *Yes, almost certainly*

- On our production servers:

  *Yes (today)*

  *Probably not (in the future)*

---

## Kubernetes resources

- The Kubernetes API defines a lot of objects called *resources*

- These resources are organized by type, or `Kind` (in the API)

- A few common resource types are:

  - node (a machine — physical or virtual — in our cluster)
  - pod (group of containers running together on a node)
  - service (stable network endpoint to connect to one or multiple containers)
  - namespace (more-or-less isolated group of things)
  - secret (bundle of sensitive data to be passed to a container)
 
  And much more! (We can see the full list by running `kubectl get`)

# Our sample application

- We will clone the GitHub repository onto our `node1`

- The repository also contains scripts and tools that we will use through the workshop

.exercise[

<!--
```bash
cd ~
if [ -d container.training ]; then
  mv container.training container.training.$RANDOM
fi
```
-->

- Clone the repository on `node1`:
  ```bash
  git clone https://https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training/
  ```

]

(You can also fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork if you prefer that.)

## Downloading and running the application

Let's start this before we look around, as downloading will take a little time...

.exercise[

- Go to the `dockercoins` directory, in the cloned repo:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/dockercoins
  ```

- Use Compose to build and run all containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

<!--
```longwait units of work done```
-->

]

Compose tells Docker to build all container images (pulling
the corresponding base images), then starts all containers,
and displays aggregated logs.

## What's this application?

--

- It is a DockerCoin miner! .emoji[💰🐳📦🚢]

--

- No, you can't buy coffee with DockerCoins

--

- How DockerCoins works:

  - generate a few random bytes

  - hash these bytes

  - increment a counter (to keep track of speed)

  - repeat forever!

--

- DockerCoins is *not* a cryptocurrency

  (the only common points are "randomness", "hashing", and "coins" in the name)

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## DockerCoins in the microservices era

- DockerCoins is made of 5 services:

  - `rng` = web service generating random bytes

  - `hasher` = web service computing hash of POSTed data

  - `worker` = background process calling `rng` and `hasher`

  - `webui` = web interface to watch progress

  - `redis` = data store (holds a counter updated by `worker`)

- These 5 services are visible in the application's Compose file,
  [docker-compose.yml](
  https://https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training//blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml)

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## How DockerCoins works

- `worker` invokes web service `rng` to generate random bytes

- `worker` invokes web service `hasher` to hash these bytes

- `worker` does this in an infinite loop

- every second, `worker` updates `redis` to indicate how many loops were done

- `webui` queries `redis`, and computes and exposes "hashing speed" in our browser

## Service discovery in container-land

How does each service find out the address of the other ones?

--

- We do not hard-code IP addresses in the code

- We do not hard-code FQDN in the code, either

- We just connect to a service name, and container-magic does the rest

  (And by container-magic, we mean "a crafty, dynamic, embedded DNS server")

## Example in `worker/worker.py`

```python
redis = Redis("`redis`")


def get_random_bytes():
    r = requests.get("http://`rng`/32")
    return r.content


def hash_bytes(data):
    r = requests.post("http://`hasher`/",
                      data=data,
                      headers={"Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"})
```

## Links, naming, and service discovery

- Containers can have network aliases (resolvable through DNS)

- Compose file version 2+ makes each container reachable through its service name

- Compose file version 1 did require "links" sections

- Network aliases are automatically namespaced

  - you can have multiple apps declaring and using a service named `database`

  - containers in the blue app will resolve `database` to the IP of the blue database

  - containers in the green app will resolve `database` to the IP of the green database

## Show me the code!

- You can check the GitHub repository with all the materials of this workshop:
  <br/>https://https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training/

- The application is in the [dockercoins](
  https://https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training//tree/master/dockercoins)
  subdirectory

- The Compose file ([docker-compose.yml](
  https://https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training//blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml))
  lists all 5 services

- `redis` is using an official image from the Docker Hub

- `hasher`, `rng`, `worker`, `webui` are each built from a Dockerfile

- Each service's Dockerfile and source code is in its own directory

  (`hasher` is in the [hasher](https://https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training//blob/master/dockercoins/hasher/) directory,
  `rng` is in the [rng](https://https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training//blob/master/dockercoins/rng/)
  directory, etc.)

## Compose file format version

*This is relevant only if you have used Compose before 2016...*

- Compose 1.6 introduced support for a new Compose file format (aka "v2")

- Services are no longer at the top level, but under a `services` section

- There has to be a `version` key at the top level, with value `"2"` (as a string, not an integer)

- Containers are placed on a dedicated network, making links unnecessary

- There are other minor differences, but upgrade is easy and straightforward

---

## Our application at work

- On the left-hand side, the "rainbow strip" shows the container names

- On the right-hand side, we see the output of our containers

- We can see the `worker` service making requests to `rng` and `hasher`

- For `rng` and `hasher`, we see HTTP access logs

## Connecting to the web UI

- "Logs are exciting and fun!" (No-one, ever)

- The `webui` container exposes a web dashboard; let's view it

.exercise[

- With a web browser, connect to `node1` on port 8000

- Remember: the `nodeX` aliases are valid only on the nodes themselves

- In your browser, you need to enter the IP address of your node

<!-- ```open http://node1:8000``` -->

]

A drawing area should show up, and after a few seconds, a blue
graph will appear.

---

class: self-paced, extra-details

## If the graph doesn't load

If you just see a `Page not found` error, it might be because your
Docker Engine is running on a different machine. This can be the case if:

- you are using the Docker Toolbox

- you are using a VM (local or remote) created with Docker Machine

- you are controlling a remote Docker Engine

When you run DockerCoins in development mode, the web UI static files
are mapped to the container using a volume. Alas, volumes can only
work on a local environment, or when using Docker Desktop for Mac or Windows.

How to fix this?

Stop the app with `^C`, edit `dockercoins.yml`, comment out the `volumes` section, and try again.

## Why does the speed seem irregular?

- It *looks like* the speed is approximately 4 hashes/second

- Or more precisely: 4 hashes/second, with regular dips down to zero

- Why?

--

class: extra-details

- The app actually has a constant, steady speed: 3.33 hashes/second
  <br/>
  (which corresponds to 1 hash every 0.3 seconds, for *reasons*)

- Yes, and?

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The reason why this graph is *not awesome*

- The worker doesn't update the counter after every loop, but up to once per second

- The speed is computed by the browser, checking the counter about once per second

- Between two consecutive updates, the counter will increase either by 4, or by 0

- The perceived speed will therefore be 4 - 4 - 4 - 0 - 4 - 4 - 0 etc.

- What can we conclude from this?

## Stopping the application

- If we interrupt Compose (with `^C`), it will politely ask the Docker Engine to stop the app

- The Docker Engine will send a `TERM` signal to the containers

- If the containers do not exit in a timely manner, the Engine sends a `KILL` signal

.exercise[

- Stop the application by hitting `^C`

<!--
```keys ^C```
-->

]

--

Some containers exit immediately, others take longer.

The containers that do not handle `SIGTERM` end up being killed after a 10s timeout. If we are very impatient, we can hit `^C` a second time!

# Declarative vs imperative

- Our container orchestrator puts a very strong emphasis on being *declarative*

- Declarative:

  *I would like a cup of tea.*

- Imperative:

  *Boil some water. Pour it in a teapot. Add tea leaves. Steep for a while. Serve in a cup.*

--

- Declarative seems simpler at first ... 

--

- ... As long as you know how to brew tea

.debug[[shared/declarative.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/shared/declarative.md)]
---

## Declarative vs imperative

- What declarative would really be:

  *I want a cup of tea, obtained by pouring an infusion¹ of tea leaves in a cup.*

--

  *¹An infusion is obtained by letting the object steep a few minutes in hot² water.*

--

  *²Hot liquid is obtained by pouring it in an appropriate container³ and setting it on a stove.*

--

  *³Ah, finally, containers! Something we know about. Let's get to work, shall we?*

--

.footnote[Did you know there was an [ISO standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3103)
specifying how to brew tea?]

.debug[[shared/declarative.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/shared/declarative.md)]
---

## Declarative vs imperative

- Imperative systems:

  - simpler

  - if a task is interrupted, we have to restart from scratch

- Declarative systems:

  - if a task is interrupted (or if we show up to the party half-way through),
    we can figure out what's missing and do only what's necessary

  - we need to be able to *observe* the system

  - ... and compute a "diff" between *what we have* and *what we want*

.debug[[shared/declarative.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/shared/declarative.md)]
---
## Declarative vs imperative in Kubernetes

- Virtually everything we create in Kubernetes is created from a *spec*

- Watch for the `spec` fields in the YAML files later!

- The *spec* describes *how we want the thing to be*

- Kubernetes will *reconcile* the current state with the spec
  <br/>(technically, this is done by a number of *controllers*)

- When we want to change some resource, we update the *spec*

- Kubernetes will then *converge* that resource

# Kubernetes network model

- TL,DR:

  *Our cluster (nodes and pods) is one big flat IP network.*

--

- In detail:

 - all nodes must be able to reach each other, without NAT

 - all pods must be able to reach each other, without NAT

 - pods and nodes must be able to reach each other, without NAT

 - each pod is aware of its IP address (no NAT)

- Kubernetes doesn't mandate any particular implementation

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

## Kubernetes network model: the good

- Everything can reach everything

- No address translation

- No port translation

- No new protocol

- Pods cannot move from a node to another and keep their IP address

- IP addresses don't have to be "portable" from a node to another

  (We can use e.g. a subnet per node and use a simple routed topology)

- The specification is simple enough to allow many various implementations

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

## Kubernetes network model: the less good

- Everything can reach everything

  - if you want security, you need to add network policies

  - the network implementation that you use needs to support them

- There are literally dozens of implementations out there

  (15 are listed in the Kubernetes documentation)

- Pods have level 3 (IP) connectivity, but *services* are level 4

  (Services map to a single UDP or TCP port; no port ranges or arbitrary IP packets)

- `kube-proxy` is on the data path when connecting to a pod or container,
  <br/>and it's not particularly fast (relies on userland proxying or iptables)

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

## Kubernetes network model: in practice

- The nodes that we are using have been set up to use [Weave](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave)

- We don't endorse Weave in a particular way, it just Works For Us

- Don't worry about the warning about `kube-proxy` performance

- Unless you:

  - routinely saturate 10G network interfaces
  - count packet rates in millions per second
  - run high-traffic VOIP or gaming platforms
  - do weird things that involve millions of simultaneous connections
    <br/>(in which case you're already familiar with kernel tuning)

- If necessary, there are alternatives to `kube-proxy`; e.g.
  [`kube-router`](https://www.kube-router.io)

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

## The Container Network Interface (CNI)

- The CNI has a well-defined [specification](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md#network-configuration) for network plugins

- When a pod is created, Kubernetes delegates the network setup to CNI plugins

- Typically, a CNI plugin will:

  - allocate an IP address (by calling an IPAM plugin)

  - add a network interface into the pod's network namespace

  - configure the interface as well as required routes etc.

- Using multiple plugins can be done with "meta-plugins" like CNI-Genie or Multus

- Not all CNI plugins are equal

  (e.g. they don't all implement network policies, which are required to isolate pods)

# First contact with `kubectl`

- `kubectl` is (almost) the only tool we'll need to talk to Kubernetes

- It is a rich CLI tool around the Kubernetes API

  (Everything you can do with `kubectl`, you can do directly with the API)

- On our machines, there is a `~/.kube/config` file with:

  - the Kubernetes API address

  - the path to our TLS certificates used to authenticate

- You can also use the `--kubeconfig` flag to pass a config file

- Or directly `--server`, `--user`, etc.

- `kubectl` can be pronounced "Cube C T L", "Cube cuttle", "Cube cuddle"...

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## `kubectl get`

- Let's look at our `Node` resources with `kubectl get`!

.exercise[

- Look at the composition of our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get node
  ```

- These commands are equivalent:
  ```bash
  kubectl get no
  kubectl get node
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Obtaining machine-readable output

- `kubectl get` can output JSON, YAML, or be directly formatted

.exercise[

- Give us more info about the nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

- Let's have some YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl get no -o yaml
  ```
  See that `kind: List` at the end? It's the type of our result!

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## (Ab)using `kubectl` and `jq`

- It's super easy to build custom reports

.exercise[

- Show the capacity of all our nodes as a stream of JSON objects:
  ```bash
    kubectl get nodes -o json | 
            jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .status.capacity"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Exploring types and definitions

- We can list all available resource types by running `kubectl api-resources`
  <br/>
  (In Kubernetes 1.10 and prior, this command used to be `kubectl get`)

- We can view the definition for a resource type with:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain type
  ```

- We can view the definition of a field in a resource, for instance:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain node.spec
  ```

- Or get the full definition of all fields and sub-fields:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain node --recursive
  ```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Introspection vs. documentation

- We can access the same information by reading the [API documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.14/)

- The API documentation is usually easier to read, but:

  - it won't show custom types (like Custom Resource Definitions)

  - we need to make sure that we look at the correct version

- `kubectl api-resources` and `kubectl explain` perform *introspection*

  (they communicate with the API server and obtain the exact type definitions)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Type names

- The most common resource names have three forms:

  - singular (e.g. `node`, `service`, `deployment`)

  - plural (e.g. `nodes`, `services`, `deployments`)

  - short (e.g. `no`, `svc`, `deploy`)

- Some resources do not have a short names

- `Endpoints` only have a plural form

  (because even a single `Endpoints` resource is actually a list of endpoints)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Viewing details

- We can use `kubectl get -o yaml` to see all available details

- However, YAML output is often simultaneously too much and not enough

- For instance, `kubectl get node node1 -o yaml` is:

  - too much information (e.g.: list of images available on this node)

  - not enough information (e.g.: doesn't show pods running on this node)

  - difficult to read for a human operator

- For a comprehensive overview, we can use `kubectl describe` instead

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## `kubectl describe`

- `kubectl describe` needs a resource type and (optionally) a resource name

- It is possible to provide a resource name *prefix*

  (all matching objects will be displayed)

- `kubectl describe` will retrieve some extra information about the resource

.exercise[

- Look at the information available for `node1` with one of the following commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe node/node1
  kubectl describe node node1
  ```

]

(We should notice a bunch of control plane pods.)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Services

- A *service* is a stable endpoint to connect to "something"

  (In the initial proposal, they were called "portals")

.exercise[

- List the services on our cluster with one of these commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get services
  kubectl get svc
  ```

]

--

There is already one service on our cluster: the Kubernetes API itself.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## ClusterIP services

- A `ClusterIP` service is internal, available from the cluster only

- This is useful for introspection from within containers

.exercise[

- Try to connect to the API:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://`10.96.0.1`
  ```
  
  - `-k` is used to skip certificate verification

  - Make sure to replace 10.96.0.1 with the CLUSTER-IP shown by `kubectl get svc`

]

--

The error that we see is expected: the Kubernetes API requires authentication.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Listing running containers

- Containers are manipulated through *pods*

- A pod is a group of containers:

 - running together (on the same node)

 - sharing resources (RAM, CPU; but also network, volumes)

.exercise[

- List pods on our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

--

*Where are the pods that we saw just a moment earlier?!?*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Namespaces

- Namespaces allow us to segregate resources

.exercise[

- List the namespaces on our cluster with one of these commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespaces
  kubectl get namespace
  kubectl get ns
  ```

]

--

*You know what ... This `kube-system` thing looks suspicious.*

*In fact, I'm pretty sure it showed up earlier, when we did:*

`kubectl describe node node1`

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Accessing namespaces

- By default, `kubectl` uses the `default` namespace

- We can see resources in all namespaces with `--all-namespaces`

.exercise[

- List the pods in all namespaces:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```

- Since Kubernetes 1.14, we can also use `-A` as a shorter version:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -A
  ```

]

*Here are our system pods!*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## What are all these control plane pods?

- `etcd` is our etcd server

- `kube-apiserver` is the API server

- `kube-controller-manager` and `kube-scheduler` are other control plane components

- `coredns` provides DNS-based service discovery ([replacing kube-dns as of 1.11](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/10/coredns-ga-for-kubernetes-cluster-dns/))

- `kube-proxy` is the (per-node) component managing port mappings and such

- `weave` is the (per-node) component managing the network overlay

- the `READY` column indicates the number of containers in each pod

  (1 for most pods, but `weave` has 2, for instance)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Scoping another namespace

- We can also look at a different namespace (other than `default`)

.exercise[

- List only the pods in the `kube-system` namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
  kubectl get pods -n kube-system
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Namespaces and other `kubectl` commands

- We can use `-n`/`--namespace` with almost every `kubectl` command

- Example:

  - `kubectl create --namespace=X` to create something in namespace X

- We can use `-A`/`--all-namespaces` with most commands that manipulate multiple objects

- Examples:

  - `kubectl delete` can delete resources across multiple namespaces

  - `kubectl label` can add/remove/update labels across multiple namespaces

- Earlier, when trying to access the API server, we got a `Forbidden` message

- But `cluster-info` is readable by everyone (even without authentication)

.exercise[

- Retrieve `cluster-info`:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://10.96.0.1/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info
  ```

]

- We were able to access `cluster-info` (without auth)

- It contains a `kubeconfig` file

---

class: extra-details

## Retrieving `kubeconfig`

- We can easily extract the `kubeconfig` file from this ConfigMap

.exercise[

- Display the content of `kubeconfig`:
  ```bash
    curl -sk https://10.96.0.1/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info \
         | jq -r .data.kubeconfig
  ```

]

- This file holds the canonical address of the API server, and the public key of the CA

- This file *does not* hold client keys or tokens

- This is not sensitive information, but allows us to establish trust

## What about `kube-node-lease`?

- Starting with Kubernetes 1.14, there is a `kube-node-lease` namespace

  (or in Kubernetes 1.13 if the NodeLease feature gate is enabled)

- That namespace contains one Lease object per node

- *Node leases* are a new way to implement node heartbeats

  (i.e. node regularly pinging the control plane to say "I'm alive!")

- For more details, see [KEP-0009] or the [node controller documentation]

# Setting up Kubernetes

- How did we set up these Kubernetes clusters that we're using?

--

- We used `kubeadm` on freshly installed VM instances running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

    1. Install Docker

    2. Install Kubernetes packages

    3. Run `kubeadm init` on the master node

    4. Set up Weave (the overlay network)
       <br/>
       (that step is just one `kubectl apply` command; discussed later)

    5. Run `kubeadm join` on the other nodes (with the token produced by `kubeadm init`)

    6. Copy the configuration file generated by `kubeadm init`

- Check the [prepare VMs README](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training/blob/master/prepare-vms/README.md) for more dedtails

.debug[[kube/setup-k8s.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/kube/setup-k8s.md)]
---

## `kubeadm` drawbacks

- Doesn't set up Docker or any other container engine

- Doesn't set up the overlay network

- Doesn't set up multi-master (no high availability)

  (At least ... not yet!)

---

## Installation with Kubeadm

.exercise[

- Configuration of Kubernetes with Kubeadm on the first node of the cluster:
  ```bash
    sudo kubeadm init 
    sudo mkdir -p $HOME/.kube /home/docker/.kube
    sudo cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
    sudo cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf /home/docker/.kube/config
    sudo chown -R $(id -u) $HOME/.kube
    kubever=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')
    kubectl apply -f https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$kubever
  ```

- Configuration of Kubernetes on the other nodes of the cluster:
- Connect on each compute node and apply the last command returned at the end of the `kubeadm init` command launched on the master node
- Test if the nodes are correctly configured by returning on the master node and executing:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

# Running our first containers on Kubernetes

- First things first: we cannot run a container

--

- We are going to run a pod, and in that pod there will be a single container

--

- In that container in the pod, we are going to run a simple `ping` command

- Then we are going to start additional copies of the pod

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Starting a simple pod with `kubectl run`

- We need to specify at least a *name* and the image we want to use

.exercise[

- Let's ping `1.1.1.1`, Cloudflare's 
  [public DNS resolver](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/):
  ```bash
  kubectl run pingpong --image alpine ping 1.1.1.1
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait deploy/pingpong --for condition=available``` -->

]

--

(Starting with Kubernetes 1.12, we get a message telling us that
`kubectl run` is deprecated. Let's ignore it for now.)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Behind the scenes of `kubectl run`

- Let's look at the resources that were created by `kubectl run`

.exercise[

- List most resource types:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

--

We should see the following things:
- `deployment.apps/pingpong` (the *deployment* that we just created)
- `replicaset.apps/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx` (a *replica set* created by the deployment)
- `pod/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy` (a *pod* created by the replica set)

Note: as of 1.10.1, resource types are displayed in more detail.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## What are these different things?

- A *deployment* is a high-level construct

  - allows scaling, rolling updates, rollbacks

  - multiple deployments can be used together to implement a
    [canary deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/#canary-deployments)

  - delegates pods management to *replica sets*

- A *replica set* is a low-level construct

  - makes sure that a given number of identical pods are running

  - allows scaling

  - rarely used directly

- A *replication controller* is the (deprecated) predecessor of a replica set

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Our `pingpong` deployment

- `kubectl run` created a *deployment*, `deployment.apps/pingpong`

```
NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/pingpong   1         1         1            1           10m
```

- That deployment created a *replica set*, `replicaset.apps/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx`

```
NAME                                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
replicaset.apps/pingpong-7c8bbcd9bc   1         1         1         10m
```

- That replica set created a *pod*, `pod/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`

```
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/pingpong-7c8bbcd9bc-6c9qz   1/1       Running   0          10m
```

- We'll see later how these folks play together for:

  - scaling, high availability, rolling updates

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Viewing container output

- Let's use the `kubectl logs` command

- We will pass either a *pod name*, or a *type/name*

  (E.g. if we specify a deployment or replica set, it will get the first pod in it)

- Unless specified otherwise, it will only show logs of the first container in the pod

  (Good thing there's only one in ours!)

.exercise[

- View the result of our `ping` command:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/pingpong
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Streaming logs in real time

- Just like `docker logs`, `kubectl logs` supports convenient options:

  - `-f`/`--follow` to stream logs in real time (à la `tail -f`)

  - `--tail` to indicate how many lines you want to see (from the end)

  - `--since` to get logs only after a given timestamp

.exercise[

- View the latest logs of our `ping` command:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/pingpong --tail 1 --follow
  ```

<!--
```wait seq=3```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Scaling our application

- We can create additional copies of our container (I mean, our pod) with `kubectl scale`

.exercise[

- Scale our `pingpong` deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deploy/pingpong --replicas 3
  ```

- Note that this command does exactly the same thing:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment pingpong --replicas 3
  ```

]

Note: what if we tried to scale `replicaset.apps/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx`?

We could! But the *deployment* would notice it right away, and scale back to the initial level.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Resilience

- The *deployment* `pingpong` watches its *replica set*

- The *replica set* ensures that the right number of *pods* are running

- What happens if pods disappear?

.exercise[

- In a separate window, list pods, and keep watching them:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

<!--
```wait Running```
```keys ^C```
```hide kubectl wait deploy pingpong --for condition=available```
```keys kubectl delete pod ping```
```copypaste pong-..........-.....```
-->

- Destroy a pod:
  ```
  kubectl delete pod pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy
  ```
]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## What if we wanted something different?

- What if we wanted to start a "one-shot" container that *doesn't* get restarted?

- We could use `kubectl run --restart=OnFailure` or `kubectl run --restart=Never`

- These commands would create *jobs* or *pods* instead of *deployments*

- Under the hood, `kubectl run` invokes "generators" to create resource descriptions

- We could also write these resource descriptions ourselves (typically in YAML),
  <br/>and create them on the cluster with `kubectl apply -f` (discussed later)

- With `kubectl run --schedule=...`, we can also create *cronjobs*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## What about that deprecation warning?

- As we can see from the previous slide, `kubectl run` can do many things

- The exact type of resource created is not obvious

- To make things more explicit, it is better to use `kubectl create`:

  - `kubectl create deployment` to create a deployment

  - `kubectl create job` to create a job

  - `kubectl create cronjob` to run a job periodically
    <br/>(since Kubernetes 1.14)

- Eventually, `kubectl run` will be used only to start one-shot pods

  (see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68132)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Various ways of creating resources

- `kubectl run` 

  - easy way to get started
  - versatile

- `kubectl create <resource>` 

  - explicit, but lacks some features
  - can't create a CronJob before Kubernetes 1.14
  - can't pass command-line arguments to deployments

- `kubectl create -f foo.yaml` or `kubectl apply -f foo.yaml`

  - all features are available
  - requires writing YAML

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Viewing logs of multiple pods

- When we specify a deployment name, only one single pod's logs are shown

- We can view the logs of multiple pods by specifying a *selector*

- A selector is a logic expression using *labels*

- Conveniently, when you `kubectl run somename`, the associated objects have a `run=somename` label

.exercise[

- View the last line of log from all pods with the `run=pingpong` label:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l run=pingpong --tail 1
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

### Streaming logs of multiple pods

- Can we stream the logs of all our `pingpong` pods?

.exercise[

- Combine `-l` and `-f` flags:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l run=pingpong --tail 1 -f
  ```

<!--
```wait seq=```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

*Note: combining `-l` and `-f` is only possible since Kubernetes 1.14!*

*Let's try to understand why ...*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

### Streaming logs of many pods

- Let's see what happens if we try to stream the logs for more than 5 pods

.exercise[

- Scale up our deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment pingpong --replicas=8
  ```

- Stream the logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l run=pingpong --tail 1 -f
  ```

]

We see a message like the following one:
```
error: you are attempting to follow 8 log streams,
but maximum allowed concurency is 5,
use --max-log-requests to increase the limit
```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Why can't we stream the logs of many pods?

- `kubectl` opens one connection to the API server per pod

- For each pod, the API server opens one extra connection to the corresponding kubelet

- If there are 1000 pods in our deployment, that's 1000 inbound + 1000 outbound connections on the API server

- This could easily put a lot of stress on the API server

- Prior Kubernetes 1.14, it was decided to *not* allow multiple connections

- From Kubernetes 1.14, it is allowed, but limited to 5 connections

  (this can be changed with `--max-log-requests`)

- For more details about the rationale, see
  [PR #67573](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67573)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Shortcomings of `kubectl logs`

- We don't see which pod sent which log line

- If pods are restarted / replaced, the log stream stops

- If new pods are added, we don't see their logs

- To stream the logs of multiple pods, we need to write a selector

- There are external tools to address these shortcomings

  (e.g.: [Stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern))

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## `kubectl logs -l ... --tail N`

- If we run this with Kubernetes 1.12, the last command shows multiple lines

- This is a regression when `--tail` is used together with `-l`/`--selector`

- It always shows the last 10 lines of output for each container

  (instead of the number of lines specified on the command line)

- The problem was fixed in Kubernetes 1.13

*See [#70554](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/70554) for details.*

## Aren't we flooding 1.1.1.1?

- If you're wondering this, good question!

- Don't worry, though:

  *APNIC's research group held the IP addresses 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1. While the addresses were valid, so many people had entered them into various random systems that they were continuously overwhelmed by a flood of garbage traffic. APNIC wanted to study this garbage traffic but any time they'd tried to announce the IPs, the flood would overwhelm any conventional network.*

  (Source: https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/)

- It's very unlikely that our concerted pings manage to produce
  even a modest blip at Cloudflare's NOC!

# Exposing containers

- `kubectl expose` creates a *service* for existing pods

- A *service* is a stable address for a pod (or a bunch of pods)

- If we want to connect to our pod(s), we need to create a *service*

- Once a service is created, CoreDNS will allow us to resolve it by name

  (i.e. after creating service `hello`, the name `hello` will resolve to something)

- There are different types of services, detailed on the following slides:

  `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, `ExternalName`

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Basic service types

- `ClusterIP` (default type)

  - a virtual IP address is allocated for the service (in an internal, private range)
  - this IP address is reachable only from within the cluster (nodes and pods)
  - our code can connect to the service using the original port number

- `NodePort`

  - a port is allocated for the service (by default, in the 30000-32768 range)
  - that port is made available *on all our nodes* and anybody can connect to it
  - our code must be changed to connect to that new port number

These service types are always available.

Under the hood: `kube-proxy` is using a userland proxy and a bunch of `iptables` rules.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## More service types

- `LoadBalancer`

  - an external load balancer is allocated for the service
  - the load balancer is configured accordingly
    <br/>(e.g.: a `NodePort` service is created, and the load balancer sends traffic to that port)
  - available only when the underlying infrastructure provides some "load balancer as a service"
    <br/>(e.g. AWS, Azure, GCE, OpenStack...)

- `ExternalName`

  - the DNS entry managed by CoreDNS will just be a `CNAME` to a provided record
  - no port, no IP address, no nothing else is allocated

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Running containers with open ports

- Since `ping` doesn't have anything to connect to, we'll have to run something else

- We could use the `nginx` official image, but ...

  ... we wouldn't be able to tell the backends from each other!

- We are going to use `jpetazzo/httpenv`, a tiny HTTP server written in Go

- `jpetazzo/httpenv` listens on port 8888

- It serves its environment variables in JSON format

- The environment variables will include `HOSTNAME`, which will be the pod name

  (and therefore, will be different on each backend)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Creating a deployment for our HTTP server

- We *could* do `kubectl run httpenv --image=jpetazzo/httpenv` ...

- But since `kubectl run` is being deprecated, let's see how to use `kubectl create` instead

.exercise[

- In another window, watch the pods (to see when they will be created):
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

<!-- ```keys ^C``` -->

- Create a deployment for this very lightweight HTTP server:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment httpenv --image=jpetazzo/httpenv
  ```

- Scale it to 10 replicas:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment httpenv --replicas=10
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Exposing our deployment

- We'll create a default `ClusterIP` service

.exercise[

- Expose the HTTP port of our server:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment httpenv --port 8888
  ```

- Look up which IP address was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Services are layer 4 constructs

- You can assign IP addresses to services, but they are still *layer 4*

  (i.e. a service is not an IP address; it's an IP address + protocol + port)

- This is caused by the current implementation of `kube-proxy`

  (it relies on mechanisms that don't support layer 3)

- As a result: you *have to* indicate the port number for your service
    
- Running services with arbitrary port (or port ranges) requires hacks

  (e.g. host networking mode)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Testing our service

- We will now send a few HTTP requests to our pods

.exercise[

- Let's obtain the IP address that was allocated for our service, *programmatically:*
  ```bash
  IP=$(kubectl get svc httpenv -o go-template --template '{{ .spec.clusterIP }}')
  ```

<!--
```hide kubectl wait deploy httpenv --for condition=available```
-->

- Send a few requests:
  ```bash
  curl http://$IP:8888/
  ```

- Too much output? Filter it with `jq`:
  ```bash
  curl -s http://$IP:8888/ | jq .HOSTNAME
  ```

]

--

Try it a few times! Our requests are load balanced across multiple pods.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## If we don't need a load balancer

- Sometimes, we want to access our scaled services directly:

  - if we want to save a tiny little bit of latency (typically less than 1ms)

  - if we need to connect over arbitrary ports (instead of a few fixed ones)

  - if we need to communicate over another protocol than UDP or TCP

  - if we want to decide how to balance the requests client-side

  - ...

- In that case, we can use a "headless service"

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Headless services

- A headless service is obtained by setting the `clusterIP` field to `None`

  (Either with `--cluster-ip=None`, or by providing a custom YAML)

- As a result, the service doesn't have a virtual IP address

- Since there is no virtual IP address, there is no load balancer either

- CoreDNS will return the pods' IP addresses as multiple `A` records

- This gives us an easy way to discover all the replicas for a deployment

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Services and endpoints

- A service has a number of "endpoints"

- Each endpoint is a host + port where the service is available

- The endpoints are maintained and updated automatically by Kubernetes

.exercise[

- Check the endpoints that Kubernetes has associated with our `httpenv` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service httpenv
  ```

]

In the output, there will be a line starting with `Endpoints:`.

That line will list a bunch of addresses in `host:port` format.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Viewing endpoint details

- When we have many endpoints, our display commands truncate the list
  ```bash
  kubectl get endpoints
  ```

- If we want to see the full list, we can use one of the following commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe endpoints httpenv
  kubectl get endpoints httpenv -o yaml
  ```

- These commands will show us a list of IP addresses

- These IP addresses should match the addresses of the corresponding pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app=httpenv -o wide
  ```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## `endpoints` not `endpoint`

- `endpoints` is the only resource that cannot be singular

```bash
$ kubectl get endpoint
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "endpoint"
```

- This is because the type itself is plural (unlike every other resource)

- There is no `endpoint` object: `type Endpoints struct`

- The type doesn't represent a single endpoint, but a list of endpoints

# Shipping images with a registry

- Initially, our app was running on a single node

- We could *build* and *run* in the same place

- Therefore, we did not need to *ship* anything

- Now that we want to run on a cluster, things are different

- The easiest way to ship container images is to use a registry

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## How Docker registries work (a reminder)

- What happens when we execute `docker run alpine` ?

- If the Engine needs to pull the `alpine` image, it expands it into `library/alpine`

- `library/alpine` is expanded into `index.docker.io/library/alpine`

- The Engine communicates with `index.docker.io` to retrieve `library/alpine:latest`

- To use something else than `index.docker.io`, we specify it in the image name

- Examples:
  ```bash
  docker pull gcr.io/google-containers/alpine-with-bash:1.0

  docker build -t registry.mycompany.io:5000/myimage:awesome .
  docker push registry.mycompany.io:5000/myimage:awesome
  ```

## Running DockerCoins on Kubernetes

- Create one deployment for each component

  (hasher, redis, rng, webui, worker)

- Expose deployments that need to accept connections

  (hasher, redis, rng, webui)

- For redis, we can use the official redis image

- For the 4 others, we need to build images and push them to some registry

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## Building and shipping images

- There are *many* options!

- Manually:

  - build locally (with `docker build` or otherwise)

  - push to the registry

- Automatically:

  - build and test locally

  - when ready, commit and push a code repository

  - the code repository notifies an automated build system

  - that system gets the code, builds it, pushes the image to the registry

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## Which registry do we want to use?

- There are SAAS products like Docker Hub, Quay ...

- Each major cloud provider has an option as well

  (ACR on Azure, ECR on AWS, GCR on Google Cloud...)

- There are also commercial products to run our own registry

  (Docker EE, Quay...)

- And open source options, too!

- When picking a registry, pay attention to its build system

  (when it has one)

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---
## Using images from the Docker Hub

- For everyone's convenience, we took care of building DockerCoins images

- We pushed these images to the DockerHub, under the [dockercoins](https://hub.docker.com/u/dockercoins) user

- These images are *tagged* with a version number, `v0.1`

- The full image names are therefore:

  - `dockercoins/hasher:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/rng:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/webui:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/worker:v0.1`

.debug[[k8s/buildshiprun-dockerhub.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/buildshiprun-dockerhub.md)]
---

## Setting `$REGISTRY` and `$TAG`

- In the upcoming exercises and labs, we use a couple of environment variables:

  - `$REGISTRY` as a prefix to all image names

  - `$TAG` as the image version tag

- For example, the worker image is `$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG`

- If you copy-paste the commands in these exercises:

  **make sure that you set `$REGISTRY` and `$TAG` first!**

- For example:
  ```
  export REGISTRY=dockercoins TAG=v0.1
  ```

  (this will expand `$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG` to `dockercoins/worker:v0.1`)

# Running our application on Kubernetes

- We can now deploy our code (as well as a redis instance)

.exercise[

- Deploy `redis`:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment redis --image=redis
  ```

- Deploy everything else:
  ```bash
    for SERVICE in hasher rng webui worker; do
      kubectl create deployment $SERVICE --image=$REGISTRY/$SERVICE:$TAG
    done
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Is this working?

- After waiting for the deployment to complete, let's look at the logs!

  (Hint: use `kubectl get deploy -w` to watch deployment events)

.exercise[

<!-- ```hide
kubectl wait deploy/rng --for condition=available
kubectl wait deploy/worker --for condition=available
``` -->

- Look at some logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/rng
  kubectl logs deploy/worker
  ```

]

--

🤔 `rng` is fine ... But not `worker`.

--

💡 Oh right! We forgot to `expose`.

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Connecting containers together

- Three deployments need to be reachable by others: `hasher`, `redis`, `rng`

- `worker` doesn't need to be exposed

- `webui` will be dealt with later

.exercise[

- Expose each deployment, specifying the right port:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment redis --port 6379
  kubectl expose deployment rng --port 80
  kubectl expose deployment hasher --port 80
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Is this working yet?

- The `worker` has an infinite loop, that retries 10 seconds after an error

.exercise[

- Stream the worker's logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/worker --follow
  ```

  (Give it about 10 seconds to recover)

<!--
```wait units of work done, updating hash counter```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

--

We should now see the `worker`, well, working happily.

---

## Exposing services for external access

- Now we would like to access the Web UI

- We will expose it with a `NodePort`

  (just like we did for the registry)

.exercise[

- Create a `NodePort` service for the Web UI:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deploy/webui --type=NodePort --port=80
  ```

- Check the port that was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc
  ```

]

## Accessing the web UI

- We can now connect to *any node*, on the allocated node port, to view the web UI

.exercise[

- Open the web UI in your browser (http://node-ip-address:3xxxx/)

<!-- ```open http://node1:3xxxx/``` -->

]

Yes, this may take a little while to update. *(Narrator: it was DNS.)*

# Accessing the API with `kubectl proxy`

- The API requires us to authenticate.red[¹]

- There are many authentication methods available, including:

  - TLS client certificates
    <br/>
    (that's what we've used so far)

  - HTTP basic password authentication
    <br/>
    (from a static file; not recommended)

  - various token mechanisms
    <br/>
    (detailed in the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authentication-strategies))

.red[¹]OK, we lied. If you don't authenticate, you are considered to
be user `system:anonymous`, which doesn't have any access rights by default.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Accessing the API directly

- Let's see what happens if we try to access the API directly with `curl`

.exercise[

- Retrieve the ClusterIP allocated to the `kubernetes` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc kubernetes
  ```

- Replace the IP below and try to connect with `curl`:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://`10.96.0.1`/
  ```

]

The API will tell us that user `system:anonymous` cannot access this path.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Authenticating to the API

If we wanted to talk to the API, we would need to:

- extract our TLS key and certificate information from `~/.kube/config`

  (the information is in PEM format, encoded in base64)

- use that information to present our certificate when connecting

  (for instance, with `openssl s_client -key ... -cert ... -connect ...`)

- figure out exactly which credentials to use

  (once we start juggling multiple clusters)

- change that whole process if we're using another authentication method

🤔 There has to be a better way!

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Using `kubectl proxy` for authentication

- `kubectl proxy` runs a proxy in the foreground

- This proxy lets us access the Kubernetes API without authentication

  (`kubectl proxy` adds our credentials on the fly to the requests)

- This proxy lets us access the Kubernetes API over plain HTTP

- This is a great tool to learn and experiment with the Kubernetes API

- ... And for serious usages as well (suitable for one-shot scripts)

- For unattended use, it is better to create a [service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Trying `kubectl proxy`

- Let's start `kubectl proxy` and then do a simple request with `curl`!

.exercise[

- Start `kubectl proxy` in the background:
  ```bash
  kubectl proxy &
  ```

- Access the API's default route:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8001
  ```

<!--
```wait /version```
```keys ^J```
-->

- Terminate the proxy:
  ```bash
  kill %1
  ```

]

The output is a list of available API routes.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## `kubectl proxy` is intended for local use

- By default, the proxy listens on port 8001

  (But this can be changed, or we can tell `kubectl proxy` to pick a port)

- By default, the proxy binds to `127.0.0.1`

  (Making it unreachable from other machines, for security reasons)

- By default, the proxy only accepts connections from:

  `^localhost$,^127\.0\.0\.1$,^\[::1\]$`

- This is great when running `kubectl proxy` locally

- Not-so-great when you want to connect to the proxy from a remote machine

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Running `kubectl proxy` on a remote machine

- If we wanted to connect to the proxy from another machine, we would need to:

  - bind to `INADDR_ANY` instead of `127.0.0.1`

  - accept connections from any address

- This is achieved with:
  ```
  kubectl proxy --port=8888 --address=0.0.0.0 --accept-hosts=.*
  ```

.warning[Do not do this on a real cluster: it opens full unauthenticated access!]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Security considerations

- Running `kubectl proxy` openly is a huge security risk

- It is slightly better to run the proxy where you need it

  (and copy credentials, e.g. `~/.kube/config`, to that place)

- It is even better to use a limited account with reduced permissions

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Good to know ...

- `kubectl proxy` also gives access to all internal services

- Specifically, services are exposed as such:
  ```
  /api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/services/<service>/proxy
  ```

- We can use `kubectl proxy` to access an internal service in a pinch

  (or, for non HTTP services, `kubectl port-forward`)

- This is not very useful when running `kubectl` directly on the cluster

  (since we could connect to the services directly anyway)

- But it is very powerful as soon as you run `kubectl` from a remote machine

# Controlling the cluster remotely

- All the operations that we do with `kubectl` can be done remotely

- In this section, we are going to use `kubectl` from our local machine

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Installing `kubectl`

- If you already have `kubectl` on your local machine, you can skip this

.exercise[

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

- Download the `kubectl` binary from one of these links:

  [Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.14.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl)
  |
  [macOS](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.14.2/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl)
  |
  [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.14.2/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe)

- On Linux and macOS, make the binary executable with `chmod +x kubectl`

  (And remember to run it with `./kubectl` or move it to your `$PATH`)

]

Note: if you are following along with a different platform (e.g. Linux on an architecture different from amd64, or with a phone or tablet), installing `kubectl` might be more complicated (or even impossible) so feel free to skip this section.

## Testing `kubectl`

- Check that `kubectl` works correctly

  (before even trying to connect to a remote cluster!)

.exercise[

- Ask `kubectl` to show its version number:
  ```bash
  kubectl version --client
  ```

]

The output should look like this:
```
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"14", GitVersion:"v1.14.0",
GitCommit:"641856db18352033a0d96dbc99153fa3b27298e5", GitTreeState:"clean",
BuildDate:"2019-03-25T15:53:57Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.1", Compiler:"gc",
Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

---

## Moving away the existing `~/.kube/config`

- If you already have a `~/.kube/config` file, move it away

  (we are going to overwrite it in the following slides!)

- If you never used `kubectl` on your machine before: nothing to do!

- If you already used `kubectl` to control a Kubernetes cluster before:

  - rename `~/.kube/config` to e.g. `~/.kube/config.bak`

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Copying the configuration file from `node1`

- The `~/.kube/config` file that is on `node1` contains all the credentials we need

- Let's copy it over!

.exercise[

- Copy the file from `node1`; if you are using macOS or Linux, you can do:
  ```
  scp `USER`@`X.X.X.X`:.kube/config ~/.kube/config
  # Make sure to replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of node1,
  # and USER with the user name used to log into node1!
  ```

- If you are using Windows, adapt these instructions to your SSH client

]

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Updating the server address

- There is a good chance that we need to update the server address

- To know if it is necessary, run `kubectl config view`

- Look for the `server:` address:

  - if it matches the public IP address of `node1`, you're good!

  - if it is anything else (especially a private IP address), update it!

- To update the server address, run:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-cluster kubernetes --server=https://`X.X.X.X`:6443
  # Make sure to replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of node1!
  ```

class: extra-details

## What if we get a certificate error?

- Generally, the Kubernetes API uses a certificate that is valid for:

  - `kubernetes`
  - `kubernetes.default`
  - `kubernetes.default.svc`
  - `kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`
  - the ClusterIP address of the `kubernetes` service
  - the hostname of the node hosting the control plane (e.g. `node1`)
  - the IP address of the node hosting the control plane

- On most clouds, the IP address of the node is an internal IP address

- ... And we are going to connect over the external IP address

- ... And that external IP address was not used when creating the certificate!

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Working around the certificate error

- We need to tell `kubectl` to skip TLS verification

  (only do this with testing clusters, never in production!)

- The following command will do the trick:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-cluster kubernetes --insecure-skip-tls-verify
  ```

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Checking that we can connect to the cluster

- We can now run a couple of trivial commands to check that all is well

.exercise[

- Check the versions of the local client and remote server:
  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

- View the nodes of the cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

We can now utilize the cluster exactly as we did before, ignoring that it's remote.

# Accessing internal services

- When we are logged in on a cluster node, we can access internal services

  (by virtue of the Kubernetes network model: all nodes can reach all pods and services)

- When we are accessing a remote cluster, things are different

  (generally, our local machine won't have access to the cluster's internal subnet)

- How can we temporarily access a service without exposing it to everyone?

--

- `kubectl proxy`: gives us access to the API, which includes a proxy for HTTP resources

- `kubectl port-forward`: allows forwarding of TCP ports to arbitrary pods, services, ...

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## Suspension of disbelief

The exercises in this section assume that we have set up `kubectl` on our
local machine in order to access a remote cluster.

We will therefore show how to access services and pods of the remote cluster,
from our local machine.

You can also run these exercises directly on the cluster (if you haven't
installed and set up `kubectl` locally).

Running commands locally will be less useful
(since you could access services and pods directly),
but keep in mind that these commands will work anywhere as long as you have
installed and set up `kubectl` to communicate with your cluster.

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## `kubectl proxy` in theory

- Running `kubectl proxy` gives us access to the entire Kubernetes API

- The API includes routes to proxy HTTP traffic

- These routes look like the following:

  `/api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/services/<service>/proxy`

- We just add the URI to the end of the request, for instance:

  `/api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/services/<service>/proxy/index.html`

- We can access `services` and `pods` this way

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## `kubectl proxy` in practice

- Let's access the `webui` service through `kubectl proxy`

.exercise[

- Run an API proxy in the background:
  ```bash
  kubectl proxy &
  ```

- Access the `webui` service:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/webui/proxy/index.html
  ```

- Terminate the proxy:
  ```bash
  kill %1
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## `kubectl port-forward` in theory

- What if we want to access a TCP service?

- We can use `kubectl port-forward` instead

- It will create a TCP relay to forward connections to a specific port

  (of a pod, service, deployment...)

- The syntax is:

  `kubectl port-forward service/name_of_service local_port:remote_port`

- If only one port number is specified, it is used for both local and remote ports

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## `kubectl port-forward` in practice

- Let's access our remote Redis server

.exercise[

- Forward connections from local port 10000 to remote port 6379:
  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/redis 10000:6379 &
  ```

- Connect to the Redis server:
  ```bash
  telnet localhost 10000
  ```

- Issue a few commands, e.g. `INFO server` then `QUIT`

<!--
```wait Connected to localhost```
```keys INFO server```
```keys ^J```
```keys QUIT```
```keys ^J```
-->

- Terminate the port forwarder:
  ```bash
  kill %1
  ```

# The Kubernetes dashboard

- Kubernetes resources can also be viewed with a web dashboard

- That dashboard is usually exposed over HTTPS

  (this requires obtaining a proper TLS certificate)

- Dashboard users need to authenticate

- We are going to take a *dangerous* shortcut

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## The insecure method

- We could (and should) use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) ...

- ... but we don't want to deal with TLS certificates

- We could (and should) learn how authentication and authorization work ...

- ... but we will use a guest account with admin access instead

.footnote[.warning[Yes, this will open our cluster to all kinds of shenanigans. Don't do this at home.]]

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Running a very insecure dashboard

- We are going to deploy that dashboard with *one single command*

- This command will create all the necessary resources

  (the dashboard itself, the HTTP wrapper, the admin/guest account)

- All these resources are defined in a YAML file

- All we have to do is load that YAML file with with `kubectl apply -f`

.exercise[

- Create all the dashboard resources, with the following command:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/insecure-dashboard.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Connecting to the dashboard

.exercise[

- Check which port the dashboard is on:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc dashboard
  ```

]

You'll want the `3xxxx` port.


.exercise[

- Connect to http://oneofournodes:3xxxx/

<!-- ```open http://node1:3xxxx/``` -->

]

The dashboard will then ask you which authentication you want to use.

.debug[[k8s/dashboard.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/dashboard.md)]
---

## Dashboard authentication

- We have three authentication options at this point:

  - token (associated with a role that has appropriate permissions)

  - kubeconfig (e.g. using the `~/.kube/config` file from `node1`)

  - "skip" (use the dashboard "service account")

- Let's use "skip": we're logged in!

--

.warning[By the way, we just added a backdoor to our Kubernetes cluster!]

# Security implications of `kubectl apply`

  - starts bitcoin miners on the whole cluster

--

  - hides in a non-default namespace

# Scaling our demo app

- Our ultimate goal is to get more DockerCoins

  (i.e. increase the number of loops per second shown on the web UI)

- Let's look at the architecture again:

  ![DockerCoins architecture](images/dockercoins-diagram.svg)

- The loop is done in the worker;
  perhaps we could try adding more workers?

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Adding another worker

- All we have to do is scale the `worker` Deployment

.exercise[

- Open two new terminals to check what's going on with pods and deployments:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  kubectl get deployments -w
  ```

<!--
```wait RESTARTS```
```keys ^C```
```wait AVAILABLE```
```keys ^C```
-->

- Now, create more `worker` replicas:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=2
  ```

]

After a few seconds, the graph in the web UI should show up.

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Adding more workers

- If 2 workers give us 2x speed, what about 3 workers?

.exercise[

- Scale the `worker` Deployment further:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=3
  ```

]

The graph in the web UI should go up again.

(This is looking great! We're gonna be RICH!)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Adding even more workers

- Let's see if 10 workers give us 10x speed!

.exercise[

- Scale the `worker` Deployment to a bigger number:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=10
  ```

]

--

The graph will peak at 10 hashes/second.

(We can add as many workers as we want: we will never go past 10 hashes/second.)

---

class: extra-details

## Didn't we briefly exceed 10 hashes/second?

- It may *look like it*, because the web UI shows instant speed

- The instant speed can briefly exceed 10 hashes/second

- The average speed cannot

- The instant speed can be biased because of how it's computed

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Why instant speed is misleading

- The instant speed is computed client-side by the web UI

- The web UI checks the hash counter once per second
  <br/>
  (and does a classic (h2-h1)/(t2-t1) speed computation)

- The counter is updated once per second by the workers

- These timings are not exact
  <br/>
  (e.g. the web UI check interval is client-side JavaScript)

- Sometimes, between two web UI counter measurements,
  <br/>
  the workers are able to update the counter *twice*

- During that cycle, the instant speed will appear to be much bigger
  <br/>
  (but it will be compensated by lower instant speed before and after)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Why are we stuck at 10 hashes per second?

- If this was high-quality, production code, we would have instrumentation

  (Datadog, Honeycomb, New Relic, statsd, Sumologic, ...)

- It's not!

- Perhaps we could benchmark our web services?

  (with tools like `ab`, or even simpler, `httping`)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Benchmarking our web services

- We want to check `hasher` and `rng`

- We are going to use `httping`

- It's just like `ping`, but using HTTP `GET` requests

  (it measures how long it takes to perform one `GET` request)

- It's used like this:
  ```
  httping [-c count] http://host:port/path
  ```

- Or even simpler:
  ```
  httping ip.ad.dr.ess
  ```

- We will use `httping` on the ClusterIP addresses of our services

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Obtaining ClusterIP addresses

- We can simply check the output of `kubectl get services`

- Or do it programmatically, as in the example below

.exercise[

- Retrieve the IP addresses:
  ```bash
  HASHER=$(kubectl get svc hasher -o go-template={{.spec.clusterIP}})
  RNG=$(kubectl get svc rng -o go-template={{.spec.clusterIP}})
  ```

]

Now we can access the IP addresses of our services through `$HASHER` and `$RNG`.

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Checking `hasher` and `rng` response times

.exercise[

- Check the response times for both services:
  ```bash
  httping -c 3 $HASHER
  httping -c 3 $RNG
  ```

]

- `hasher` is fine (it should take a few milliseconds to reply)

- `rng` is not (it should take about 700 milliseconds if there are 10 workers)

- Something is wrong with `rng`, but ... what?

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---
## Let's draw hasty conclusions

- The bottleneck seems to be `rng`

- *What if* we don't have enough entropy and can't generate enough random numbers?

- We need to scale out the `rng` service on multiple machines!

Note: this is a fiction! We have enough entropy. But we need a pretext to scale out.

(In fact, the code of `rng` uses `/dev/urandom`, which never runs out of entropy...
<br/>
...and is [just as good as `/dev/random`](http://www.slideshare.net/PacSecJP/filippo-plain-simple-reality-of-entropy).)
