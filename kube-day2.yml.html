# Upgrading clusters

- It's *recommended* to run consistent versions across a cluster

  (mostly to have feature parity and latest security updates)

- It's not *mandatory*

  (otherwise, cluster upgrades would be a nightmare!)

- Components can be upgraded one at a time without problems

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Checking what we're running

- It's easy to check the version for the API server

.exercise[

- Log into node `node1`

- Check the version of kubectl and of the API server:
  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

]

- In a HA setup with multiple API servers, they can have different versions

- Running the command above multiple times can return different values

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Node versions

- It's also easy to check the version of kubelet

.exercise[

- Check node versions (includes kubelet, kernel, container engine):
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

]

- Different nodes can run different kubelet versions

- Different nodes can run different kernel versions

- Different nodes can run different container engines

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Control plane versions

- If the control plane is self-hosted (running in pods), we can check it

.exercise[

- Show image versions for all pods in `kube-system` namespace:
  ```bash
    kubectl --namespace=kube-system get pods -o json \
            | jq -r '
              .items[]
              | [.spec.nodeName, .metadata.name]
                + 
                (.spec.containers[].image | split(":"))
              | @tsv
              ' \
            | column -t
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## What version are we running anyway?

- When I say, "I'm running Kubernetes 1.11", is that the version of:

  - kubectl

  - API server

  - kubelet

  - controller manager

  - something else?

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Other versions that are important

- etcd

- kube-dns or CoreDNS

- CNI plugin(s)

- Network controller, network policy controller

- Container engine

- Linux kernel

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## General guidelines

- To update a component, use whatever was used to install it

- If it's a distro package, update that distro package

- If it's a container or pod, update that container or pod

- If you used configuration management, update with that

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Know where your binaries come from

- Sometimes, we need to upgrade *quickly*

  (when a vulnerability is announced and patched)

- If we are using an installer, we should:

  - make sure it's using upstream packages

  - or make sure that whatever packages it uses are current

  - make sure we can tell it to pin specific component versions

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## In practice

- We are going to update a few cluster components

- We will change the kubelet version on one node

- We will change the version of the API server

- We will work with our cluster

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Updating kubelet

- These nodes have been installed using the official Kubernetes packages

- We can therefore use `apt` or `apt-get`

.exercise[

- Log into node `node2` as docker and then change to root

- View available versions for package `kubelet`:
  ```bash
  apt show kubelet -a | grep ^Version
  ```

- Upgrade kubelet:
  ```bash
  apt install kubelet=1.14.2-00
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

.exercise[

- Log into node `node1`

- Check node versions:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

- Create a deployment and scale it to make sure that the node still works

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Updating the API server

- This cluster has been deployed with kubeadm

- The control plane runs in *static pods*

- These pods are started automatically by kubelet

  (even when kubelet can't contact the API server)

- They are defined in YAML files in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`

  (this path is set by a kubelet command-line flag)

- kubelet automatically updates the pods when the files are changed

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Changing the API server version

- We will edit the YAML file to use a different image version

.exercise[

- Log into node `node1`

- Check API server version:
  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

- Edit the API server pod manifest:
  ```bash
  sudo vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
  ```

- Look for the `image:` line, and update it to e.g. `v1.14.0`

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

- The API server will be briefly unavailable while kubelet restarts it

.exercise[

- Check the API server version:
  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Updating the whole control plane

- As an example, we'll use kubeadm to upgrade the entire control plane

  (note: this is possible only because the cluster was installed with kubeadm)

.exercise[

- Check what will be upgraded:
  ```bash
  sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
  ```

  (Note: kubeadm is confused by our manual upgrade of the API server.
  <br/>It thinks the cluster is running 1.14.0!)

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

- Perform the upgrade:
  ```bash
  sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.14.2
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Updating kubelets

- After updating the control plane, we need to update each kubelet

- This requires to run a special command on each node, to download the config

  (this config is generated by kubeadm)

.exercise[

- Download the configuration on each node, and upgrade kubelet:
  ```bash
    for N in 1 2 3; do
    	ssh node$N sudo kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version v1.14.2
  	  ssh node $N sudo apt install kubelet=1.14.2-00
    done
  ```
]

.debug[[k8s/cluster-upgrade.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-upgrade.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

- All our nodes should now be updated to version 1.14.2

.exercise[

- Check nodes versions:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

]

# Static pods

- Hosting the Kubernetes control plane on Kubernetes has advantages:

  - we can use Kubernetes' replication and scaling features for the control plane

  - we can leverage rolling updates to upgrade the control plane

- However, there is a catch:

  - deploying on Kubernetes requires the API to be available

  - the API won't be available until the control plane is deployed

- How can we get out of that chicken-and-egg problem?

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## A possible approach

- Since each component of the control plane can be replicated ...

- We could set up the control plane outside of the cluster

- Then, once the cluster is fully operational, create replicas running on the cluster

- Finally, remove the replicas that are running outside of the cluster

*What could possibly go wrong?*

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Sawing off the branch you're sitting on

- What if anything goes wrong?

  (During the setup or at a later point)

- Worst case scenario, we might need to:

  - set up a new control plane (outside of the cluster)
  
  - restore a backup from the old control plane
  
  - move the new control plane to the cluster (again)

- This doesn't sound like a great experience

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Static pods to the rescue

- Pods are started by kubelet (an agent running on every node)

- To know which pods it should run, the kubelet queries the API server

- The kubelet can also get a list of *static pods* from:

  - a directory containing one (or multiple) *manifests*, and/or
  
  - a URL (serving a *manifest*)

- These "manifests" are basically YAML definitions

  (As produced by `kubectl get pod my-little-pod -o yaml --export`)

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Static pods are dynamic

- Kubelet will periodically reload the manifests

- It will start/stop pods accordingly

  (i.e. it is not necessary to restart the kubelet after updating the manifests)

- When connected to the Kubernetes API, the kubelet will create *mirror pods*

- Mirror pods are copies of the static pods

  (so they can be seen with e.g. `kubectl get pods`)

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Bootstrapping a cluster with static pods

- We can run control plane components with these static pods

- They can start without requiring access to the API server

- Once they are up and running, the API becomes available

- These pods are then visible through the API

  (We cannot upgrade them from the API, though)

*This is how kubeadm has initialized our clusters.*

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Static pods vs normal pods

- The API only gives us a read-only access to static pods

- We can `kubectl delete` a static pod ...

  ... But the kubelet will restart it immediately

- Static pods can be selected just like other pods

  (So they can receive service traffic)

- A service can select a mixture of static and other pods

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## From static pods to normal pods

- Once the control plane is up and running, it can be used to create normal pods

- We can then set up a copy of the control plane in normal pods

- Then the static pods can be removed

- The scheduler and the controller manager use leader election

  (Only one is active at a time; removing an instance is seamless)

- Each instance of the API server adds itself to the `kubernetes` service

- Etcd will typically require more work!

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## From normal pods back to static pods

- Alright, but what if the control plane is down and we need to fix it?

- We restart it using static pods!

- This can be done automatically with the [Pod Checkpointer]

- The Pod Checkpointer automatically generates manifests of running pods

- The manifests are used to restart these pods if API contact is lost

  (More details in the [Pod Checkpointer] documentation page)

- This technique is used by [bootkube]

[Pod Checkpointer]: https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/bootkube/blob/master/cmd/checkpoint/README.md
[bootkube]: https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/bootkube

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Where should the control plane run?

*Is it better to run the control plane in static pods, or normal pods?*

- If I'm a *user* of the cluster: I don't care, it makes no difference to me

- What if I'm an *admin*, i.e. the person who installs, upgrades, repairs... the cluster?

- If I'm using a managed Kubernetes cluster (AKS, EKS, GKE...) it's not my problem

  (I'm not the one setting up and managing the control plane)

- If I already picked a tool (kubeadm, kops...) to set up my cluster, the tool decides for me

- What if I haven't picked a tool yet, or if I'm installing from scratch?

  - static pods = easier to set up, easier to troubleshoot, less risk of outage

  - normal pods = easier to upgrade, easier to move (if nodes need to be shut down)

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

## Static pods in action

- On our clusters, the `staticPodPath` is `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`

.exercise[

- Have a look at this directory:
  ```bash
  ls -l /etc/kubernetes/manifests
  ```

]

We should see YAML files corresponding to the pods of the control plane.

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

class: static-pods-exercise

## Running a static pod

- We are going to add a pod manifest to the directory, and kubelet will run it

.exercise[

- Copy a manifest to the directory:
  ```bash
  sudo cp ~/kube.training/k8s/just-a-pod.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests
  ```

- Check that it's running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

The output should include a pod named `hello-node1`.

.debug[[k8s/staticpods.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/staticpods.md)]
---

class: static-pods-exercise

## Remarks

In the manifest, the pod was named `hello`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
Kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hello
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hello
    image: nginx
```

The `-node1` suffix was added automatically by kubelet.

If we delete the pod (with `kubectl delete`), it will be recreated immediately.

To delete the pod, we need to delete (or move) the manifest file.

# Backing up clusters

- Backups can have multiple purposes:

  - disaster recovery (servers or storage are destroyed or unreachable)

  - error recovery (human or process has altered or corrupted data)

  - cloning environments (for testing, validation ...)

- Let's see the strategies and tools available with Kubernetes!

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Important

- Kubernetes helps us with disaster recovery

  (it gives us replication primitives)

- Kubernetes helps us to clone / replicate environments

  (all resources can be described with manifests)

- Kubernetes *does not* help us with error recovery

- We still need to backup / snapshot our data:

  - with database backups (mysqldump, pgdump, etc.)

  - and/or snapshots at the storage layer

  - and/or traditional full disk backups

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## In a perfect world ...

- The deployment of our Kubernetes clusters is automated

  (recreating a cluster takes less than a minute of human time)

- All the resources (Deployments, Services...) on our clusters are under version control

  (never use `kubectl run`; always apply YAML files coming from a repository)

- Stateful components are either:

  - stored on systems with regular snapshots

  - backed up regularly to an external, durable storage

  - outside of Kubernetes

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Kubernetes cluster deployment

- If our deployment system isn't fully automated, it should at least be documented

- Litmus test: how long does it take to deploy a cluster ...

  - for a senior engineer?

  - for a new hire?

- Does it require external intervention?

  (e.g. provisioning servers, signing TLS certs ...)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Plan B

- Full machine backups of the control plane can help

- If the control plane is in pods (or containers), pay attention to storage drivers

  (if the backup mechanism is not container-aware, the backups can take way more resources than they should, or even be unusable!)

- If the previous sentence worries you:

  **automate the deployment of your clusters!**

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Managing our Kubernetes resources

- Ideal scenario:

  - never create a resource directly on a cluster

  - push to a code repository

  - a special branch (`production` or even `master`) gets automatically deployed

- Some folks call this "GitOps"

  (it's the logical evolution of configuration management and infrastructure as code)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## GitOps in theory

- What do we keep in version control?

- For very simple scenarios: source code, Dockerfiles, scripts

- For real applications: add resources (as YAML files)

- For applications deployed multiple times: Helm, Kustomize ...

  (staging and production count as "multiple times")

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## GitOps tooling

- Various tools exist (Weave Flux, GitKube...)

- These tools are still very young

- You still need to write YAML for all your resources

- There is no tool to:

  - list *all* resources in a namespace

  - get resource YAML in a canonical form

  - diff YAML descriptions with current state

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## GitOps in practice

- Start describing your resources with YAML

- Leverage a tool like Kustomize or Helm

- Make sure that you can easily deploy to a new namespace

  (or even better: to a new cluster)

- When tooling matures, you will be ready

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Plan B

- What if we can't describe everything with YAML?

- What if we manually create resources and forget to commit them to source control?

- What about global resources, that don't live in a namespace?

- How can we be sure that we saved *everything*?

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Backing up etcd

- All objects are saved in etcd

- etcd data should be relatively small

  (and therefore, quick and easy to back up)

- Two options to back up etcd:

  - snapshot the data directory

  - use `etcdctl snapshot`

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]

## Making an etcd snapshot

- The basic command is simple:
  ```bash
  etcdctl snapshot save <filename>
  ```

- But we also need to specify:

  - an environment variable to specify that we want etcdctl v3

  - the address of the server to back up

  - the path to the key, certificate, and CA certificate
    <br/>(if our etcd uses TLS certificates)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Snapshotting etcd on kubeadm

- The following command will work on clusters deployed with kubeadm

  (and maybe others)

- It should be executed on a master node

```bash
docker run --rm --net host -v $PWD:/vol \
    -v /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd:/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd:ro \
    -e ETCDCTL_API=3 k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.3.10 \
    etcdctl --endpoints=https://[127.0.0.1]:2379 \
            --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
            --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.crt \
            --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.key \
            snapshot save /vol/snapshot
```

- It will create a file named `snapshot` in the current directory

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## How can we remember all these flags?

- Look at the static pod manifest for etcd

  (in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`)

- The healthcheck probe is calling `etcdctl` with all the right flags 
  😉👍✌️

- Exercise: write the YAML for a batch job to perform the backup

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Restoring an etcd snapshot

- ~~Execute exactly the same command, but replacing `save` with `restore`~~

  (Believe it or not, doing that will *not* do anything useful!)

- The `restore` command does *not* load a snapshot into a running etcd server

- The `restore` command creates a new data directory from the snapshot

  (it's an offline operation; it doesn't interact with an etcd server)

- It will create a new data directory in a temporary container

  (leaving the running etcd node untouched)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## When using kubeadm

1. Create a new data directory from the snapshot:
   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /var/lib/etcd
   docker run --rm -v /var/lib:/var/lib -v $PWD:/vol \
          -e ETCDCTL_API=3 k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.3.10 \
          etcdctl snapshot restore /vol/snapshot --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd
   ```

2. Provision the control plane, using that data directory:
   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm init \
        --ignore-preflight-errors=DirAvailable--var-lib-etcd
   ```

3. Rejoin the other nodes

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## The fine print

- This only saves etcd state

- It **does not** save persistent volumes and local node data

- Some critical components (like the pod network) might need to be reset

- As a result, our pods might have to be recreated, too

- If we have proper liveness checks, this should happen automatically

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## More information about etcd backups

- [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/#built-in-snapshot) about etcd backups

- [etcd documentation](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/op-guide/recovery.html#snapshotting-the-keyspace) about snapshots and restore

- [A good blog post by elastisys](https://elastisys.com/2018/12/10/backup-kubernetes-how-and-why/) explaining how to restore a snapshot

- [Another good blog post by consol labs](https://labs.consol.de/kubernetes/2018/05/25/kubeadm-backup.html) on the same topic

.debug[[k8s/cluster-backup.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/cluster-backup.md)]
---

## Don't forget ...

- Also back up the TLS information

  (at the very least: CA key and cert; API server key and cert)

- With clusters provisioned by kubeadm, this is in `/etc/kubernetes/pki`

- If you don't:

  - you will still be able to restore etcd state and bring everything back up

  - you will need to redistribute user certificates

.warning[**TLS information is highly sensitive! 
<br/>Anyone who has it has full access to your cluster!**]

# Daemon sets

- We want to scale `rng` in a way that is different from how we scaled `worker`

- We want one (and exactly one) instance of `rng` per node

- What if we just scale up `deploy/rng` to the number of nodes?

  - nothing guarantees that the `rng` containers will be distributed evenly

  - if we add nodes later, they will not automatically run a copy of `rng`

  - if we remove (or reboot) a node, one `rng` container will restart elsewhere

- Instead of a `deployment`, we will use a `daemonset`

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Daemon sets in practice

- Daemon sets are great for cluster-wide, per-node processes:

  - `kube-proxy`

  - `weave` (our overlay network)

  - monitoring agents

  - hardware management tools (e.g. SCSI/FC HBA agents)

  - etc.

- They can also be restricted to run [only on some nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#running-pods-on-only-some-nodes)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Creating a daemon set

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

- Unfortunately, as of Kubernetes 1.14, the CLI cannot create daemon sets

--

- More precisely: it doesn't have a subcommand to create a daemon set

--

- But any kind of resource can always be created by providing a YAML description:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f foo.yaml
  ```

--

- How do we create the YAML file for our daemon set?

--

  - option 1: [read the docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#create-a-daemonset)

--

  - option 2: `vi` our way out of it

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Creating the YAML file for our daemon set

- Let's start with the YAML file for the current `rng` resource

.exercise[

- Dump the `rng` resource in YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl get deploy/rng -o yaml --export >rng.yml 
  ```

- Edit `rng.yml`

]

Note: `--export` will remove "cluster-specific" information, i.e.:
- namespace (so that the resource is not tied to a specific namespace)
- status and creation timestamp (useless when creating a new resource)
- resourceVersion and uid (these would cause... *interesting* problems)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## "Casting" a resource to another

- What if we just changed the `kind` field?

  (It can't be that easy, right?)

.exercise[

- Change `kind: Deployment` to `kind: DaemonSet`

<!--
```bash vim rng.yml```
```wait kind: Deployment```
```keys /Deployment```
```keys ^J```
```keys cwDaemonSet```
```keys ^[``` ]
```keys :wq```
```keys ^J```
-->

- Save, quit

- Try to create our new resource:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f rng.yml
  ```

]

--

We all knew this couldn't be that easy, right!

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Understanding the problem

- The core of the error is:
  ```
  error validating data:
  [ValidationError(DaemonSet.spec):
  unknown field "replicas" in io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.DaemonSetSpec,
  ...
  ```

--

- *Obviously,* it doesn't make sense to specify a number of replicas for a daemon set

--

- Workaround: fix the YAML

  - remove the `replicas` field
  - remove the `strategy` field (which defines the rollout mechanism for a deployment)
  - remove the `progressDeadlineSeconds` field (also used by the rollout mechanism)
  - remove the `status: {}` line at the end

--

- Or, we could also ...

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Use the `--force`, Luke

- We could also tell Kubernetes to ignore these errors and try anyway

- The `--force` flag's actual name is `--validate=false`

.exercise[

- Try to load our YAML file and ignore errors:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rng.yml --validate=false
  ```

]

--

🎩✨🐇

--

Wait ... Now, can it be *that* easy?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

- Did we transform our `deployment` into a `daemonset`?

.exercise[

- Look at the resources that we have now:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

--

We have two resources called `rng`:

- the *deployment* that was existing before

- the *daemon set* that we just created

We also have one too many pods.
<br/>
(The pod corresponding to the *deployment* still exists.)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## `deploy/rng` and `ds/rng`

- You can have different resource types with the same name

  (i.e. a *deployment* and a *daemon set* both named `rng`)

- We still have the old `rng` *deployment*

  ```
NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/rng        1         1         1            1           18m
  ```

- But now we have the new `rng` *daemon set* as well

  ```
NAME                DESIRED  CURRENT  READY  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE  NODE SELECTOR  AGE
daemonset.apps/rng  2        2        2      2           2          <none>         9s
  ```

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Too many pods

- If we check with `kubectl get pods`, we see:

  - *one pod* for the deployment (named `rng-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`)

  - *one pod per node* for the daemon set (named `rng-zzzzz`)

  ```
  NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  rng-54f57d4d49-7pt82        1/1       Running   0          11m
  rng-b85tm                   1/1       Running   0          25s
  rng-hfbrr                   1/1       Running   0          25s
  [...]
  ```

--

The daemon set created one pod per node, except on the master node.

The master node has [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) preventing pods from running there.

(To schedule a pod on this node anyway, the pod will require appropriate [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/).)

.footnote[(Off by one? We don't run these pods on the node hosting the control plane.)]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Is this working?

- Look at the web UI

--

- The graph should now go above 10 hashes per second!

--

- It looks like the newly created pods are serving traffic correctly

- How and why did this happen?

  (We didn't do anything special to add them to the `rng` service load balancer!)

# Labels and selectors

- The `rng` *service* is load balancing requests to a set of pods

- That set of pods is defined by the *selector* of the `rng` service

.exercise[

- Check the *selector* in the `rng` service definition:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service rng
  ```

]

- The selector is `app=rng`

- It means "all the pods having the label `app=rng`"

  (They can have additional labels as well, that's OK!)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Selector evaluation

- We can use selectors with many `kubectl` commands

- For instance, with `kubectl get`, `kubectl logs`, `kubectl delete` ... and more

.exercise[

- Get the list of pods matching selector `app=rng`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app=rng
  kubectl get pods --selector app=rng
  ```

]

But ... why do these pods (in particular, the *new* ones) have this `app=rng` label?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Where do labels come from?

- When we create a deployment with `kubectl create deployment rng`,
  <br/>this deployment gets the label `app=rng`

- The replica sets created by this deployment also get the label `app=rng`

- The pods created by these replica sets also get the label `app=rng`

- When we created the daemon set from the deployment, we re-used the same spec

- Therefore, the pods created by the daemon set get the same labels

.footnote[Note: when we use `kubectl run stuff`, the label is `run=stuff` instead.]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating load balancer configuration

- We would like to remove a pod from the load balancer

- What would happen if we removed that pod, with `kubectl delete pod ...`?

--

  It would be re-created immediately (by the replica set or the daemon set)

--

- What would happen if we removed the `app=rng` label from that pod?

--

  It would *also* be re-created immediately

--

  Why?!?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Selectors for replica sets and daemon sets

- The "mission" of a replica set is:

  "Make sure that there is the right number of pods matching this spec!"

- The "mission" of a daemon set is:

  "Make sure that there is a pod matching this spec on each node!"

--

- *In fact,* replica sets and daemon sets do not check pod specifications

- They merely have a *selector*, and they look for pods matching that selector

- Yes, we can fool them by manually creating pods with the "right" labels

- Bottom line: if we remove our `app=rng` label ...

 ... The pod "diseappears" for its parent, which re-creates another pod to replace it

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Isolation of replica sets and daemon sets

- Since both the `rng` daemon set and the `rng` replica set use `app=rng` ...

  ... Why don't they "find" each other's pods?

--

- *Replica sets* have a more specific selector, visible with `kubectl describe`

  (It looks like `app=rng,pod-template-hash=abcd1234`)

- *Daemon sets* also have a more specific selector, but it's invisible

  (It looks like `app=rng,controller-revision-hash=abcd1234`)

- As a result, each controller only "sees" the pods it manages

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Removing a pod from the load balancer

- Currently, the `rng` service is defined by the `app=rng` selector

- The only way to remove a pod is to remove or change the `app` label

- ... But that will cause another pod to be created instead!

- What's the solution?

--

- We need to change the selector of the `rng` service!

- Let's add another label to that selector (e.g. `enabled=yes`) 

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Complex selectors

- If a selector specifies multiple labels, they are understood as a logical *AND*

  (In other words: the pods must match all the labels)

- Kubernetes has support for advanced, set-based selectors

  (But these cannot be used with services, at least not yet!)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## The plan

1. Add the label `enabled=yes` to all our `rng` pods

2. Update the selector for the `rng` service to also include `enabled=yes`

3. Toggle traffic to a pod by manually adding/removing the `enabled` label

4. Profit!

*Note: if we swap steps 1 and 2, it will cause a short
service disruption, because there will be a period of time
during which the service selector won't match any pod.
During that time, requests to the service will time out.
By doing things in the order above, we guarantee that there won't
be any interruption.*

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Adding labels to pods

- We want to add the label `enabled=yes` to all pods that have `app=rng`

- We could edit each pod one by one with `kubectl edit` ...

- ... Or we could use `kubectl label` to label them all

- `kubectl label` can use selectors itself

.exercise[

- Add `enabled=yes` to all pods that have `app=rng`:
  ```bash
  kubectl label pods -l app=rng enabled=yes
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating the service selector

- We need to edit the service specification

- Reminder: in the service definition, we will see `app: rng` in two places

  - the label of the service itself (we don't need to touch that one)

  - the selector of the service (that's the one we want to change)

.exercise[

- Update the service to add `enabled: yes` to its selector:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit service rng
  ```

<!--
```wait Please edit the object below```
```keys /app: rng```
```keys ^J```
```keys noenabled: yes```
```keys ^[``` ]
```keys :wq```
```keys ^J```
-->

]

--

... And then we get *the weirdest error ever.* Why?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## When the YAML parser is being too smart

- YAML parsers try to help us:

  - `xyz` is the string `"xyz"`

  - `42` is the integer `42`

  - `yes` is the boolean value `true`

- If we want the string `"42"` or the string `"yes"`, we have to quote them

- So we have to use `enabled: "yes"`

.footnote[For a good laugh: if we had used "ja", "oui", "si" ... as the value, it would have worked!]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating the service selector, take 2

.exercise[

- Update the service to add `enabled: "yes"` to its selector:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit service rng
  ```

<!--
```wait Please edit the object below```
```keys /app: rng```
```keys ^J```
```keys noenabled: "yes"```
```keys ^[``` ]
```keys :wq```
```keys ^J```
-->

]

This time it should work!

If we did everything correctly, the web UI shouldn't show any change.

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating labels

- We want to disable the pod that was created by the deployment

- All we have to do, is remove the `enabled` label from that pod

- To identify that pod, we can use its name

- ... Or rely on the fact that it's the only one with a `pod-template-hash` label

- Good to know:

  - `kubectl label ... foo=` doesn't remove a label (it sets it to an empty string)

  - to remove label `foo`, use `kubectl label ... foo-`

  - to change an existing label, we would need to add `--overwrite`

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Removing a pod from the load balancer

.exercise[

- In one window, check the logs of that pod:
  ```bash
  POD=$(kubectl get pod -l app=rng,pod-template-hash -o name)
  kubectl logs --tail 1 --follow $POD

  ```
  (We should see a steady stream of HTTP logs)

- In another window, remove the label from the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl label pod -l app=rng,pod-template-hash enabled-
  ```
  (The stream of HTTP logs should stop immediately)

]

There might be a slight change in the web UI (since we removed a bit
of capacity from the `rng` service). If we remove more pods,
the effect should be more visible.

class: extra-details

## Updating the daemon set

- If we scale up our cluster by adding new nodes, the daemon set will create more pods

- These pods won't have the `enabled=yes` label

- If we want these pods to have that label, we need to edit the daemon set spec

- We can do that with e.g. `kubectl edit daemonset rng`

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## We've put resources in your resources

- Reminder: a daemon set is a resource that creates more resources!

- There is a difference between:

  - the label(s) of a resource (in the `metadata` block in the beginning)

  - the selector of a resource (in the `spec` block)

  - the label(s) of the resource(s) created by the first resource (in the `template` block)

- We would need to update the selector and the template

  (metadata labels are not mandatory)

- The template must match the selector

  (i.e. the resource will refuse to create resources that it will not select)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Labels and debugging

- When a pod is misbehaving, we can delete it: another one will be recreated

- But we can also change its labels

- It will be removed from the load balancer (it won't receive traffic anymore)

- Another pod will be recreated immediately

- But the problematic pod is still here, and we can inspect and debug it

- We can even re-add it to the rotation if necessary

  (Very useful to troubleshoot intermittent and elusive bugs)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Labels and advanced rollout control

- Conversely, we can add pods matching a service's selector

- These pods will then receive requests and serve traffic

- Examples:

  - one-shot pod with all debug flags enabled, to collect logs

  - pods created automatically, but added to rotation in a second step
    <br/>
    (by setting their label accordingly)

- This gives us building blocks for canary and blue/green deployments

# Rolling updates

- By default (without rolling updates), when a scaled resource is updated:

  - new pods are created

  - old pods are terminated
  
  - ... all at the same time
  
  - if something goes wrong, ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling updates

- With rolling updates, when a resource is updated, it happens progressively

- Two parameters determine the pace of the rollout: `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge`

- They can be specified in absolute number of pods, or percentage of the `replicas` count

- At any given time ...

  - there will always be at least `replicas`-`maxUnavailable` pods available

  - there will never be more than `replicas`+`maxSurge` pods in total

  - there will therefore be up to `maxUnavailable`+`maxSurge` pods being updated

- We have the possibility to rollback to the previous version
  <br/>(if the update fails or is unsatisfactory in any way)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Checking current rollout parameters

- Recall how we build custom reports with `kubectl` and `jq`:

.exercise[

- Show the rollout plan for our deployments:
  ```bash
    kubectl get deploy -o json |
            jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .spec.strategy.rollingUpdate"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---


## Rolling updates in practice

- As of Kubernetes 1.8, we can do rolling updates with:

  `deployments`, `daemonsets`, `statefulsets`

- Editing one of these resources will automatically result in a rolling update

- Rolling updates can be monitored with the `kubectl rollout` subcommand

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Building a new version of the `worker` service

.exercise[

- Go to the `stack` directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/stacks
  ```

- Edit `dockercoins/worker/worker.py`; update the first `sleep` line to sleep 1 second

- Build a new tag and push it to the registry:
  ```bash
  #export REGISTRY=localhost:3xxxx
  export TAG=v0.2
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml build
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml push
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling out the new `worker` service

.exercise[

- Let's monitor what's going on by opening a few terminals, and run:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  kubectl get replicasets -w
  kubectl get deployments -w
  ```

<!--
```wait NAME```
```keys ^C```
-->

- Update `worker` either with `kubectl edit`, or by running:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deploy worker worker=$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG
  ```

]

--

That rollout should be pretty quick. What shows in the web UI?

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Give it some time

- At first, it looks like nothing is happening (the graph remains at the same level)

- According to `kubectl get deploy -w`, the `deployment` was updated really quickly

- But `kubectl get pods -w` tells a different story

- The old `pods` are still here, and they stay in `Terminating` state for a while

- Eventually, they are terminated; and then the graph decreases significantly

- This delay is due to the fact that our worker doesn't handle signals

- Kubernetes sends a "polite" shutdown request to the worker, which ignores it

- After a grace period, Kubernetes gets impatient and kills the container

  (The grace period is 30 seconds, but [can be changed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#termination-of-pods) if needed)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling out something invalid

- What happens if we make a mistake?

.exercise[

- Update `worker` by specifying a non-existent image:
  ```bash
  export TAG=v0.3
  kubectl set image deploy worker worker=$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG
  ```

- Check what's going on:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout status deploy worker
  ```

<!--
```wait Waiting for deployment```
```keys ^C```
-->

Our rollout is stuck. However, the app is not dead.

(After a minute, it will stabilize to be 20-25% slower.)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## What's going on with our rollout?

- Why is our app a bit slower?

- Because `MaxUnavailable=25%`

  ... So the rollout terminated 2 replicas out of 10 available

- Okay, but why do we see 5 new replicas being rolled out?

- Because `MaxSurge=25%`

  ... So in addition to replacing 2 replicas, the rollout is also starting 3 more

- It rounded down the number of MaxUnavailable pods conservatively,
  <br/>
  but the total number of pods being rolled out is allowed to be 25+25=50%

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The nitty-gritty details

- We start with 10 pods running for the `worker` deployment

- Current settings: MaxUnavailable=25% and MaxSurge=25%

- When we start the rollout:

  - two replicas are taken down (as per MaxUnavailable=25%)
  - two others are created (with the new version) to replace them
  - three others are created (with the new version) per MaxSurge=25%)

- Now we have 8 replicas up and running, and 5 being deployed

- Our rollout is stuck at this point!

## Checking the dashboard during the bad rollout

If you haven't deployed the Kubernetes dashboard earlier, just skip this slide.

.exercise[

- Check which port the dashboard is on:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system get svc socat
  ```

]

Note the `3xxxx` port.

.exercise[

- Connect to http://oneofournodes:3xxxx/

<!-- ```open https://node1:3xxxx/``` -->

]

--

- We have failures in Deployments, Pods, and Replica Sets

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Recovering from a bad rollout

- We could push some `v0.3` image

  (the pod retry logic will eventually catch it and the rollout will proceed)

- Or we could invoke a manual rollback

.exercise[

<!--
```keys
^C
```
-->

- Cancel the deployment and wait for the dust to settle down:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deploy worker
  kubectl rollout status deploy worker
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Changing rollout parameters

- We want to:

  - revert to `v0.1`
  - be conservative on availability (always have desired number of available workers)
  - go slow on rollout speed (update only one pod at a time) 
  - give some time to our workers to "warm up" before starting more

The corresponding changes can be expressed in the following YAML snippet:

.small[
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: worker
        image: $REGISTRY/worker:v0.1
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1
  minReadySeconds: 10
```
]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Applying changes through a YAML patch

- We could use `kubectl edit deployment worker`

- But we could also use `kubectl patch` with the exact YAML shown before

.exercise[

.small[

- Apply all our changes and wait for them to take effect:
  ```bash
  kubectl patch deployment worker -p "
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: worker
            image: $REGISTRY/worker:v0.1
      strategy:
        rollingUpdate:
          maxUnavailable: 0
          maxSurge: 1
      minReadySeconds: 10
    "
  kubectl rollout status deployment worker
  kubectl get deploy -o json worker |
          jq "{name:.metadata.name} + .spec.strategy.rollingUpdate"
  ```
  ]

# Healthchecks

- Kubernetes provides two kinds of healthchecks: liveness and readiness

- Healthchecks are *probes* that apply to *containers* (not to pods)

- Each container can have two (optional) probes:

  - liveness = is this container dead or alive?

  - readiness = is this container ready to serve traffic?

- Different probes are available (HTTP, TCP, program execution)

- Let's see the difference and how to use them!

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Liveness probe

- Indicates if the container is dead or alive

- A dead container cannot come back to life

- If the liveness probe fails, the container is killed

  (to make really sure that it's really dead; no zombies or undeads!)

- What happens next depends on the pod's `restartPolicy`:

  - `Never`: the container is not restarted

  - `OnFailure` or `Always`: the container is restarted

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## When to use a liveness probe

- To indicate failures that can't be recovered

  - deadlocks (causing all requests to time out)

  - internal corruption (causing all requests to error)

- If the liveness probe fails *N* consecutive times, the container is killed

- *N* is the `failureThreshold` (3 by default)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Readiness probe

- Indicates if the container is ready to serve traffic

- If a container becomes "unready" (let's say busy!) it might be ready again soon

- If the readiness probe fails:

  - the container is *not* killed

  - if the pod is a member of a service, it is temporarily removed

  - it is re-added as soon as the readiness probe passes again

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## When to use a readiness probe

- To indicate temporary failures

  - the application can only service *N* parallel connections

  - the runtime is busy doing garbage collection or initial data load

- The container is marked as "not ready" after `failureThreshold` failed attempts

  (3 by default)

- It is marked again as "ready" after `successThreshold` successful attempts

  (1 by default)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Different types of probes

- HTTP request

  - specify URL of the request (and optional headers)

  - any status code between 200 and 399 indicates success

- TCP connection

  - the probe succeeds if the TCP port is open

- arbitrary exec

  - a command is executed in the container

  - exit status of zero indicates success

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Benefits of using probes

- Rolling updates proceed when containers are *actually ready*

  (as opposed to merely started)

- Containers in a broken state gets killed and restarted

  (instead of serving errors or timeouts)

- Overloaded backends get removed from load balancer rotation

  (thus improving response times across the board)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Example: HTTP probe

Here is a pod template for the `rng` web service of the DockerCoins app:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: rng-with-liveness
spec:
  containers:
  - name: rng
    image: dockercoins/rng:v0.1
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      periodSeconds: 1
```

If the backend serves an error, or takes longer than 1s, 3 times in a row, it gets killed.

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Example: exec probe

Here is a pod template for a Redis server:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis-with-liveness
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command: ["redis-cli", "ping"]
```

If the Redis process becomes unresponsive, it will be killed.

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Details about liveness and readiness probes

- Probes are executed at intervals of `periodSeconds` (default: 10)

- The timeout for a probe is set with `timeoutSeconds` (default: 1)

- A probe is considered successful after `successThreshold` successes (default: 1)

- A probe is considered failing after `failureThreshold` failures (default: 3)

- If a probe is not defined, it's as if there was an "always successful" probe

# Accessing logs from the CLI

- The `kubectl logs` commands has limitations:

  - it cannot stream logs from multiple pods at a time

  - when showing logs from multiple pods, it mixes them all together

- We are going to see how to do it better

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Doing it manually

- We *could* (if we were so inclined), write a program or script that would:

  - take a selector as an argument

  - enumerate all pods matching that selector (with `kubectl get -l ...`)

  - fork one `kubectl logs --follow ...` command per container

  - annotate the logs (the output of each `kubectl logs ...` process) with their origin

  - preserve ordering by using `kubectl logs --timestamps ...` and merge the output

--

- We *could* do it, but thankfully, others did it for us already!

## Stern

[Stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern) is an open source project
by [Wercker](http://www.wercker.com/).

From the README:

*Stern allows you to tail multiple pods on Kubernetes and multiple containers within the pod. Each result is color coded for quicker debugging.*

*The query is a regular expression so the pod name can easily be filtered and you don't need to specify the exact id (for instance omitting the deployment id). If a pod is deleted it gets removed from tail and if a new pod is added it automatically gets tailed.*

Exactly what we need!

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Installing Stern

- Run `stern` (without arguments) to check if it's installed:

  ```
  $ stern
  Tail multiple pods and containers from Kubernetes

  Usage:
    stern pod-query [flags]
  ```

- If it is not installed, the easiest method is to download a [binary release](https://github.com/wercker/stern/releases)

- The following commands will install Stern on a Linux Intel 64 bit machine:
  ```bash
  sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/stern \
       https://github.com/wercker/stern/releases/download/1.10.0/stern_linux_amd64
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/stern
  ```

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Using Stern

- There are two ways to specify the pods for which we want to see the logs:

  - `-l` followed by a selector expression (like with many `kubectl` commands)

  - with a "pod query", i.e. a regex used to match pod names

- These two ways can be combined if necessary

.exercise[

- View the logs for all the rng containers:
  ```bash
  stern rng
  ```

<!--
```wait HTTP/1.1```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Stern convenient options

- The `--tail N` flag shows the last `N` lines for each container

  (Instead of showing the logs since the creation of the container)

- The `-t` / `--timestamps` flag shows timestamps

- The `--all-namespaces` flag is self-explanatory

.exercise[

- View what's up with the `weave` system containers:
  ```bash
  stern --tail 1 --timestamps --all-namespaces weave
  ```

<!--
```wait weave-npc```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Using Stern with a selector

- When specifying a selector, we can omit the value for a label

- This will match all objects having that label (regardless of the value)

- Everything created with `kubectl run` has a label `run`

- We can use that property to view the logs of all the pods created with `kubectl run`

- Similarly, everything created with `kubectl create deployment` has a label `app`

.exercise[

- View the logs for all the things started with `kubectl create deployment`:
  ```bash
  stern -l app
  ```

<!--
```wait units of work```
```keys ^C```
-->

# Centralized logging

- Using `kubectl` or `stern` is simple; but it has drawbacks:

  - when a node goes down, its logs are not available anymore

  - we can only dump or stream logs; we want to search/index/count...

- We want to send all our logs to a single place

- We want to parse them (e.g. for HTTP logs) and index them

- We want a nice web dashboard

--

- We are going to deploy an EFK stack

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## What is EFK?

- EFK is three components:

  - ElasticSearch (to store and index log entries)

  - Fluentd (to get container logs, process them, and put them in ElasticSearch)

  - Kibana (to view/search log entries with a nice UI)

- The only component that we need to access from outside the cluster will be Kibana

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Deploying EFK on our cluster

- We are going to use a YAML file describing all the required resources

.exercise[

- Load the YAML file into our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/kube.training/k8s/efk.yaml
  ```

]

If we [look at the YAML file](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/k8s/efk.yaml), we see that
it creates a daemon set, two deployments, two services,
and a few roles and role bindings (to give fluentd the required permissions).

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## The itinerary of a log line (before Fluentd)

- A container writes a line on stdout or stderr

- Both are typically piped to the container engine (Docker or otherwise)

- The container engine reads the line, and sends it to a logging driver

- The timestamp and stream (stdout or stderr) is added to the log line

- With the default configuration for Kubernetes, the line is written to a JSON file

  (`/var/log/containers/pod-name_namespace_container-id.log`)

- That file is read when we invoke `kubectl logs`; we can access it directly too

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## The itinerary of a log line (with Fluentd)

- Fluentd runs on each node (thanks to a daemon set)

- It binds-mounts `/var/log/containers` from the host (to access these files)

- It continuously scans this directory for new files; reads them; parses them

- Each log line becomes a JSON object, fully annotated with extra information:
  <br/>container id, pod name, Kubernetes labels ...

- These JSON objects are stored in ElasticSearch

- ElasticSearch indexes the JSON objects

- We can access the logs through Kibana (and perform searches, counts, etc.)

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Accessing Kibana

- Kibana offers a web interface that is relatively straightforward

- Let's check it out!

.exercise[

- Check which `NodePort` was allocated to Kibana:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc kibana
  ```

- With our web browser, connect to Kibana

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Using Kibana

*Note: this is not a Kibana workshop! So this section is deliberately very terse.*

- The first time you connect to Kibana, you must "configure an index pattern"

- Just use the one that is suggested, `@timestamp`.red[*]

- Then click "Discover" (in the top-left corner)

- You should see container logs

- Advice: in the left column, select a few fields to display, e.g.:

  `kubernetes.host`, `kubernetes.pod_name`, `stream`, `log`

.red[*]If you don't see `@timestamp`, it's probably because no logs exist yet.
<br/>Wait a bit, and double-check the logging pipeline!

.debug[[k8s/logs-centralized.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/logs-centralized.md)]
---

## Caveat emptor

We are using EFK because it is relatively straightforward
to deploy on Kubernetes, without having to redeploy or reconfigure
our cluster. But it doesn't mean that it will always be the best
option for your use-case. If you are running Kubernetes in the
cloud, you might consider using the cloud provider's logging
infrastructure (if it can be integrated with Kubernetes).

The deployment method that we will use here has been simplified:
there is only one ElasticSearch node. In a real deployment, you
might use a cluster, both for performance and reliability reasons.
But this is outside of the scope of this chapter.

The YAML file that we used creates all the resources in the
`default` namespace, for simplicity. In a real scenario, you will
create the resources in the `kube-system` namespace or in a dedicated namespace.

# Managing stacks with Helm

- We created our first resources with `kubectl run`, `kubectl expose` ...

- We have also created resources by loading YAML files with `kubectl apply -f`

- For larger stacks, managing thousands of lines of YAML is unreasonable

- These YAML bundles need to be customized with variable parameters

  (E.g.: number of replicas, image version to use ...)

- It would be nice to have an organized, versioned collection of bundles

- It would be nice to be able to upgrade/rollback these bundles carefully

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is an open source project offering all these things!

.debug[[k8s/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/helm.md)]
---

## Helm concepts

- `helm` is a CLI tool

- `tiller` is its companion server-side component

- A "chart" is an archive containing templatized YAML bundles

- Charts are versioned

- Charts can be stored on private or public repositories

.debug[[k8s/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/helm.md)]
---

## Installing Helm

- If the `helm` CLI is not installed in your environment, install it

.exercise[

- Check if `helm` is installed:
  ```bash
  helm
  ```

- If it's not installed, run the following command:
  ```bash
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get | bash
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/helm.md)]
---

## Installing Tiller

- Tiller is composed of a *service* and a *deployment* in the `kube-system` namespace

- They can be managed (installed, upgraded...) with the `helm` CLI

.exercise[

- Deploy Tiller:
  ```bash
  helm init
  ```

]

If Tiller was already installed, don't worry: this won't break it.

At the end of the install process, you will see:

```
Happy Helming!
```

.debug[[k8s/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/helm.md)]
---

## Fix account permissions

- Helm permission model requires us to tweak permissions

- In a more realistic deployment, you might create per-user or per-team
  service accounts, roles, and role bindings

.exercise[

- Grant `cluster-admin` role to `kube-system:default` service account:
  ```bash
  kubectl create clusterrolebinding add-on-cluster-admin \
      --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:default
  ```

]

(Defining the exact roles and permissions on your cluster requires
a deeper knowledge of Kubernetes' RBAC model. The command above is
fine for personal and development clusters.)

.debug[[k8s/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/helm.md)]
---

## View available charts

- A public repo is pre-configured when installing Helm

- We can view available charts with `helm search` (and an optional keyword)

.exercise[

- View all available charts:
  ```bash
  helm search
  ```

- View charts related to `prometheus`:
  ```bash
  helm search prometheus
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/helm.md)]
---

## Install a chart

- Most charts use `LoadBalancer` service types by default

- Most charts require persistent volumes to store data

- We need to relax these requirements a bit

.exercise[

- Install the Prometheus metrics collector on our cluster:
  ```bash
  helm install stable/prometheus \
         --set server.service.type=NodePort \
         --set server.persistentVolume.enabled=false
  ```

]

Where do these `--set` options come from?

.debug[[k8s/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/helm.md)]
---

## Inspecting a chart

- `helm inspect` shows details about a chart (including available options)

.exercise[

- See the metadata and all available options for `stable/prometheus`:
  ```bash
  helm inspect stable/prometheus
  ```

]

The chart's metadata includes an URL to the project's home page.

(Sometimes it conveniently points to the documentation for the chart.)

.debug[[k8s/helm.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/helm.md)]
---

## Viewing installed charts

- Helm keeps track of what we've installed

.exercise[

- List installed Helm charts:
  ```bash
  helm list
  ```

]

# Kustomize

- Kustomize lets us transform YAML files representing Kubernetes resources

- The original YAML files are valid resource files

  (e.g. they can be loaded with `kubectl apply -f`)

- They are left untouched by Kustomize

- Kustomize lets us define *overlays* that extend or change the resource files

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Differences with Helm

- Helm Charts use placeholders `{{ like.this }}`

- Kustomize "bases" are standard Kubernetes YAML

- It is possible to use an existing set of YAML as a Kustomize base

- As a result, writing a Helm Chart is more work ...

- ... But Helm Charts are also more powerful; e.g. they can:

  - use flags to conditionally include resources or blocks

  - check if a given Kubernetes API group is supported

  - [and much more](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/)

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Kustomize concepts

- Kustomize needs a `kustomization.yaml` file

- That file can be a *base* or a *variant*

- If it's a *base*:

  - it lists YAML resource files to use

- If it's a *variant* (or *overlay*):

  - it refers to (at least) one *base*

  - and some *patches*

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## An easy way to get started with Kustomize

- We are going to use [Replicated Ship](https://www.replicated.com/ship/) to experiment with Kustomize

- The [Replicated Ship CLI](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship/releases) has been installed on our clusters

- Replicated Ship has multiple workflows; here is what we will do:

  - initialize a Kustomize overlay from a remote GitHub repository

  - customize some values using the web UI provided by Ship

  - look at the resulting files and apply them to the cluster

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Getting started with Ship

- We need to run `ship init` in a new directory

- `ship init` requires an URL to a remote repository containing Kubernetes YAML

- It will clone that repository and start a web UI

- Later, it can watch that repository and/or update from it

- We will use the [jpetazzo/kubercoins](https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins) repository

  (it contains all the DockerCoins resources as YAML files)

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## `ship init`

.exercise[

- Change to a new directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/kubercoins
  cd ~/kubercoins
  ```

- Run `ship init` with the kubercoins repository:
  ```bash
  ship init https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Access the web UI

- `ship init` tells us to connect on `localhost:8800`

- We need to replace `localhost` with the address of our node

  (since we run on a remote machine)

- Follow the steps in the web UI, and change one parameter

  (e.g. set the number of replicas in the worker Deployment)

- Complete the web workflow, and go back to the CLI

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Inspect the results

- Look at the content of our directory

- `base` contains the kubercoins repository + a `kustomization.yaml` file

- `overlays/ship` contains the Kustomize overlay referencing the base + our patch(es)

- `rendered.yaml` is a YAML bundle containing the patched application

- `.ship` contains a state file used by Ship

.debug[[k8s/kustomize.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/kustomize.md)]
---

## Using the results

- We can `kubectl apply -f rendered.yaml`

  (on any version of Kubernetes)

- Starting with Kubernetes 1.14, we can apply the overlay directly with:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k overlays/ship
  ```

- But let's not do that for now!

- We will create a new copy of DockerCoins in another namespace

# Namespaces

- We cannot have two resources with the same name

  (Or can we...?)

--

- We cannot have two resources *of the same type* with the same name

  (But it's OK to have a `rng` service, a `rng` deployment, and a `rng` daemon set!)

--

- We cannot have two resources of the same type with the same name *in the same namespace*

  (But it's OK to have e.g. two `rng` services in different namespaces!)

--

- In other words: **the tuple *(type, name, namespace)* needs to be unique**

  (In the resource YAML, the type is called `Kind`)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Pre-existing namespaces

- If we deploy a cluster with `kubeadm`, we have three or four namespaces:

  - `default` (for our applications)

  - `kube-system` (for the control plane)

  - `kube-public` (contains one ConfigMap for cluster discovery)

  - `kube-node-lease` (in Kubernetes 1.14 and later; contains Lease objects)

- If we deploy differently, we may have different namespaces

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Creating namespaces

- Creating a namespace is done with the `kubectl create namespace` command:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace blue
  ```

- We can also get fancy and use a very minimal YAML snippet, e.g.:
  ```bash
	kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Namespace
	metadata:
	  name: blue
	EOF
  ```

- The two methods above are identical

- If we are using a tool like Helm, it will create namespaces automatically

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Using namespaces

- We can pass a `-n` or `--namespace` flag to most `kubectl` commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n blue get svc
  ```

- We can also change our current *context*

- A context is a *(user, cluster, namespace)* tuple

- We can manipulate contexts with the `kubectl config` command

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Viewing existing contexts

- On our training environments, at this point, there should be only one context

.exercise[

- View existing contexts to see the cluster name and the current user:
  ```bash
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```

]

- The current context (the only one!) is tagged with a `*`

- What are NAME, CLUSTER, AUTHINFO, and NAMESPACE?

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## What's in a context

- NAME is an arbitrary string to identify the context

- CLUSTER is a reference to a cluster

  (i.e. API endpoint URL, and optional certificate)

- AUTHINFO is a reference to the authentication information to use

  (i.e. a TLS client certificate, token, or otherwise)

- NAMESPACE is the namespace

  (empty string = `default`)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Switching contexts

- We want to use a different namespace

- Solution 1: update the current context

  *This is appropriate if we need to change just one thing (e.g. namespace or authentication).*

- Solution 2: create a new context and switch to it

  *This is appropriate if we need to change multiple things and switch back and forth.*

- Let's go with solution 1!

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Updating a context

- This is done through `kubectl config set-context`

- We can update a context by passing its name, or the current context with `--current`

.exercise[

- Update the current context to use the `blue` namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=blue
  ```

- Check the result:
  ```bash
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Using our new namespace

- Let's check that we are in our new namespace, then deploy a new copy of Dockercoins

.exercise[

- Verify that the new context is empty:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Deploy DockerCoins with Helm

*Follow these instructions if you previously created a Helm Chart.*

.exercise[

- Deploy DockerCoins:
  ```bash
  helm install dockercoins
  ```

]

In the last command line, `dockercoins` is just the local path where
we created our Helm chart before.

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Deploy DockerCoins with Kustomize

*Follow these instructions if you previously created a Kustomize overlay.*

.exercise[

- Deploy DockerCoins:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rendered.yaml
  ```

- Or, with Kubernetes 1.14, you can also do this:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k overlays/ship
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Viewing the deployed app

- Let's see if this worked correctly!

.exercise[

- Retrieve the port number allocated to the `webui` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc webui
  ```

- Point our browser to http://X.X.X.X:3xxxx

]

If the graph shows up but stays at zero, check the next slide!

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Troubleshooting

If did the exercices from the chapter about labels and selectors,
the app that you just created may not work, because the `rng` service
selector has `enabled=yes` but the pods created by the `rng` daemon set
do not have that label.

How can we troubleshoot that?

- Query individual services manually

  → the `rng` service will time out

- Inspect the services with `kubectl describe service`
  
  → the `rng` service will have an empty list of backends

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Fixing the broken service

The easiest option is to add the `enabled=yes` label to the relevant pods.

.exercise[

- Add the `enabled` label to the pods of the `rng` daemon set:
  ```bash
  kubectl label pods -l app=rng enabled=yes
  ```

]

The *best* option is to change either the service definition, or the
daemon set definition, so that their respective selectors match correctly.

*This is left as an exercise for the reader!*

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Namespaces and isolation

- Namespaces *do not* provide isolation

- A pod in the `green` namespace can communicate with a pod in the `blue` namespace

- A pod in the `default` namespace can communicate with a pod in the `kube-system` namespace

- CoreDNS uses a different subdomain for each namespace

- Example: from any pod in the cluster, you can connect to the Kubernetes API with:

  `https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local:443/`

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Isolating pods

- Actual isolation is implemented with *network policies*

- Network policies are resources (like deployments, services, namespaces...)

- Network policies specify which flows are allowed:

  - between pods

  - from pods to the outside world

  - and vice-versa

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Switch back to the default namespace

- Let's make sure that we don't run future exercises in the `blue` namespace

.exercise[

- Switch back to the original context:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=
  ```

]

Note: we could have used `--namespace=default` for the same result.

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Switching namespaces more easily

- We can also use a little helper tool called `kubens`:

  ```bash
  # Switch to namespace foo
  kubens foo
  # Switch back to the previous namespace
  kubens -
  ```

- On our clusters, `kubens` is called `kns` instead

  (so that it's even fewer keystrokes to switch namespaces)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

##  `kubens` and `kubectx`

- With `kubens`, we can switch quickly between namespaces

- With `kubectx`, we can switch quickly between contexts

- Both tools are simple shell scripts available from https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx

- On our clusters, they are installed as `kns` and `kctx`

  (for brevity and to avoid completion clashes between `kubectx` and `kubectl`)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## `kube-ps1`

- It's easy to lose track of our current cluster / context / namespace

- `kube-ps1` makes it easy to track these, by showing them in our shell prompt

- It's a simple shell script available from https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1

- On our clusters, `kube-ps1` is installed and included in `PS1`:
  ```
  [123.45.67.89] `(kubernetes-admin@kubernetes:default)` docker@node1 ~
  ```
  (The highlighted part is `context:namespace`, managed by `kube-ps1`)

- Highly recommended if you work across multiple contexts or namespaces!

# Network policies

- Namespaces help us to *organize* resources

- Namespaces do not provide isolation

- By default, every pod can contact every other pod

- By default, every service accepts traffic from anyone

- If we want this to be different, we need *network policies*

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## What's a network policy?

A network policy is defined by the following things.

- A *pod selector* indicating which pods it applies to

  e.g.: "all pods in namespace `blue` with the label `zone=internal`"

- A list of *ingress rules* indicating which inbound traffic is allowed

  e.g.: "TCP connections to ports 8000 and 8080 coming from pods with label `zone=dmz`,
  and from the external subnet 4.42.6.0/24, except 4.42.6.5"

- A list of *egress rules* indicating which outbound traffic is allowed

A network policy can provide ingress rules, egress rules, or both.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## How do network policies apply?

- A pod can be "selected" by any number of network policies

- If a pod isn't selected by any network policy, then its traffic is unrestricted

  (In other words: in the absence of network policies, all traffic is allowed)

- If a pod is selected by at least one network policy, then all traffic is blocked ...

  ... unless it is explicitly allowed by one of these network policies

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Traffic filtering is flow-oriented

- Network policies deal with *connections*, not individual packets

- Example: to allow HTTP (80/tcp) connections to pod A, you only need an ingress rule

  (You do not need a matching egress rule to allow response traffic to go through)

- This also applies for UDP traffic

  (Allowing DNS traffic can be done with a single rule)

- Network policy implementations use stateful connection tracking

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Pod-to-pod traffic

- Connections from pod A to pod B have to be allowed by both pods:

  - pod A has to be unrestricted, or allow the connection as an *egress* rule

  - pod B has to be unrestricted, or allow the connection as an *ingress* rule

- As a consequence: if a network policy restricts traffic going from/to a pod,
  <br/>
  the restriction cannot be overridden by a network policy selecting another pod

- This prevents an entity managing network policies in namespace A
  (but without permission to do so in namespace B)
  from adding network policies giving them access to namespace B

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## The rationale for network policies

- In network security, it is generally considered better to "deny all, then allow selectively"

  (The other approach, "allow all, then block selectively" makes it too easy to leave holes)

- As soon as one network policy selects a pod, the pod enters this "deny all" logic

- Further network policies can open additional access

- Good network policies should be scoped as precisely as possible

- In particular: make sure that the selector is not too broad

  (Otherwise, you end up affecting pods that were otherwise well secured)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Our first network policy

This is our game plan:

- run a web server in a pod

- create a network policy to block all access to the web server

- create another network policy to allow access only from specific pods

## Running our test web server

.exercise[

- Let's use the `nginx` image:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment testweb --image=nginx
  ```

- Find out the IP address of the pod with one of these two commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide -l app=testweb
  IP=$(kubectl get pods -l app=testweb -o json | jq -r .items[0].status.podIP)
  ```

- Check that we can connect to the server:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  ```
]

The `curl` command should show us the "Welcome to nginx!" page.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Adding a very restrictive network policy

- The policy will select pods with the label `app=testweb`

- It will specify an empty list of ingress rules (matching nothing)

.exercise[

- Apply the policy in this YAML file:
  ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ~/kube.training/k8s/netpol-deny-all-for-testweb.yaml
  ```

- Check if we can still access the server:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  ```

]

The `curl` command should now time out.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Looking at the network policy

This is the file that we applied:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-all-for-testweb
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: testweb
  ingress: []
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Allowing connections only from specific pods

- We want to allow traffic from pods with the label `run=testcurl`

- Reminder: this label is automatically applied when we do `kubectl run testcurl ...`

.exercise[

- Apply another policy:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/kube.training/k8s/netpol-allow-testcurl-for-testweb.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Looking at the network policy

This is the second file that we applied:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-testcurl-for-testweb
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: testweb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          run: testcurl
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Testing the network policy

- Let's create pods with, and without, the required label

.exercise[

- Try to connect to testweb from a pod with the `run=testcurl` label:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testcurl --rm -i --image=centos -- curl -m3 $IP
  ```

- Try to connect to testweb with a different label:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testkurl --rm -i --image=centos -- curl -m3 $IP
  ```

]

The first command will work (and show the "Welcome to nginx!" page).

The second command will fail and time out after 3 seconds.

(The timeout is obtained with the `-m3` option.)

## An important warning

- Some network plugins only have partial support for network policies

- For instance, Weave added support for egress rules [in version 2.4](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/pull/3313) (released in July 2018)

- But only recently added support for ipBlock [in version 2.5](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/pull/3367) (released in Nov 2018)

- Unsupported features might be silently ignored

  (Making you believe that you are secure, when you're not)

## Network policies, pods, and services

- Network policies apply to *pods*

- A *service* can select multiple pods

  (And load balance traffic across them)

- It is possible that we can connect to some pods, but not some others

  (Because of how network policies have been defined for these pods)

- In that case, connections to the service will randomly pass or fail

  (Depending on whether the connection was sent to a pod that we have access to or not)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Network policies and namespaces

- A good strategy is to isolate a namespace, so that:

  - all the pods in the namespace can communicate together

  - other namespaces cannot access the pods

  - external access has to be enabled explicitly

- Let's see what this would look like for the DockerCoins app!

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Network policies for DockerCoins

- We are going to apply two policies

- The first policy will prevent traffic from other namespaces

- The second policy will allow traffic to the `webui` pods

- That's all we need for that app!

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Blocking traffic from other namespaces

This policy selects all pods in the current namespace.

It allows traffic only from pods in the current namespace.

(An empty `podSelector` means "all pods".)

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-from-other-namespaces
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Allowing traffic to `webui` pods

This policy selects all pods with label `app=webui`.

It allows traffic from any source.

(An empty `from` fields means "all sources".)

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-webui
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webui
  ingress:
  - from: []
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Applying both network policies

- Both network policies are declared in the file `k8s/netpol-dockercoins.yaml`

.exercise[

- Apply the network policies:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/kube.training/k8s/netpol-dockercoins.yaml
  ```

- Check that we can still access the web UI from outside
  <br/>
  (and that the app is still working correctly!)

- Check that we can't connect anymore to `rng` or `hasher` through their ClusterIP

]

Note: using `kubectl proxy` or `kubectl port-forward` allows us to connect
regardless of existing network policies. This allows us to debug and
troubleshoot easily, without having to poke holes in our firewall.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Cleaning up our network policies

- The network policies that we have installed block all traffic to the default namespace

- We should remove them, otherwise further exercises will fail!

.exercise[

- Remove all network policies:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete networkpolicies --all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Protecting the control plane

- Should we add network policies to block unauthorized access to the control plane?

  (etcd, API server, etc.)

--

- At first, it seems like a good idea ...

--

- But it *shouldn't* be necessary:

  - not all network plugins support network policies

  - the control plane is secured by other methods (mutual TLS, mostly)

  - the code running in our pods can reasonably expect to contact the API
    <br/>
    (and it can do so safely thanks to the API permission model)

- If we block access to the control plane, we might disrupt legitimate code

- ... Without necessarily improving security

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Further resources

- As always, the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) is a good starting point

- The API documentation has a lot of detail about the format of various objects:

  - [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.12/#networkpolicy-v1-networking-k8s-io)

  - [NetworkPolicySpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.12/#networkpolicyspec-v1-networking-k8s-io)

  - [NetworkPolicyIngressRule](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.12/#networkpolicyingressrule-v1-networking-k8s-io)

  - etc.

- And two resources by [Ahmet Alp Balkan](https://ahmet.im/):

  - a [very good talk about network policies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLj6h78yzYM2P-3-xqvmWaZbbI1sW-ulZb&v=3gGpMmYeEO8) at KubeCon North America 2017

  - a repository of [ready-to-use recipes](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes) for network policies

# Authentication and authorization

*And first, a little refresher!*

- Authentication = verifying the identity of a person

  On a UNIX system, we can authenticate with login+password, SSH keys ...

- Authorization = listing what they are allowed to do

  On a UNIX system, this can include file permissions, sudoer entries ...

- Sometimes abbreviated as "authn" and "authz"

- In good modular systems, these things are decoupled

   (so we can e.g. change a password or SSH key without having to reset access rights)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication in Kubernetes

- When the API server receives a request, it tries to authenticate it

  (it examines headers, certificates ... anything available)

- Many authentication methods are available and can be used simultaneously

  (we will see them on the next slide)

- It's the job of the authentication method to produce:

  - the user name
  - the user ID
  - a list of groups

- The API server doesn't interpret these; it'll be the job of *authorizers*

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication methods

- TLS client certificates

  (that's what we've been doing with `kubectl` so far)

- Bearer tokens

  (a secret token in the HTTP headers of the request)

- [HTTP basic auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

  (carrying user and password in a HTTP header)

- Authentication proxy

  (sitting in front of the API and setting trusted headers)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Anonymous requests

- If any authentication method *rejects* a request, it's denied

  (`401 Unauthorized` HTTP code)

- If a request is neither rejected nor accepted by anyone, it's anonymous

  - the user name is `system:anonymous`

  - the list of groups is `[system:unauthenticated]`

- By default, the anonymous user can't do anything

  (that's what you get if you just `curl` the Kubernetes API)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication with TLS certificates

- This is enabled in most Kubernetes deployments

- The user name is derived from the `CN` in the client certificates

- The groups are derived from the `O` fields in the client certificate

- From the point of view of the Kubernetes API, users do not exist

  (i.e. they are not stored in etcd or anywhere else)

- Users can be created (and given membership to groups) independently of the API

- The Kubernetes API can be set up to use your custom CA to validate client certs

class: extra-details

## Viewing our admin certificate

- Let's inspect the certificate we've been using all this time!

.exercise[

- This command will show the `CN` and `O` fields for our certificate:
  ```bash
  kubectl config view \
          --raw \
          -o json \
          | jq -r .users[0].user[\"client-certificate-data\"] \
          | openssl base64 -d -A \
          | openssl x509 -text \
          | grep Subject:
  ```

]

Let's break down that command together! 😅

---

class: extra-details

## Breaking down the command

- `kubectl config view` shows the Kubernetes user configuration
- `--raw` includes certificate information (which shows as REDACTED otherwise)
- `-o json` outputs the information in JSON format
- `| jq ...` extracts the field with the user certificate (in base64)
- `| openssl base64 -d -A` decodes the base64 format (now we have a PEM file)
- `| openssl x509 -text` parses the certificate and outputs it as plain text
- `| grep Subject:` shows us the line that interests us

→ We are user `kubernetes-admin`, in group `system:masters`.

(We will see later how and why this gives us the permissions that we have.)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## User certificates in practice

- The Kubernetes API server does not support certificate revocation

  (see issue [#18982](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/18982))

- As a result, we cannot easily suspend a user's access

- There are workarounds, but they are very inconvenient:

  - issue short-lived certificates (e.g. 24 hours) and regenerate them often

  - re-create the CA and re-issue all certificates in case of compromise

  - grant permissions to individual users, not groups
    <br/>
    (and remove all permissions to a compromised user)

- Until this is fixed, we probably want to use other methods

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication with tokens

- Tokens are passed as HTTP headers:

  `Authorization: Bearer and-then-here-comes-the-token`

- Tokens can be validated through a number of different methods:

  - static tokens hard-coded in a file on the API server

  - [bootstrap tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/) (special case to create a cluster or join nodes)

  - [OpenID Connect tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) (to delegate authentication to compatible OAuth2 providers)

  - service accounts (these deserve more details, coming right up!)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Service accounts

- A service account is a user that exists in the Kubernetes API

  (it is visible with e.g. `kubectl get serviceaccounts`)

- Service accounts can therefore be created / updated dynamically

  (they don't require hand-editing a file and restarting the API server)

- A service account is associated with a set of secrets

  (the kind that you can view with `kubectl get secrets`)

- Service accounts are generally used to grant permissions to applications, services ...

  (as opposed to humans)

class: extra-details

## Token authentication in practice

- We are going to list existing service accounts

- Then we will extract the token for a given service account

- And we will use that token to authenticate with the API

## Listing service accounts

.exercise[

- The resource name is `serviceaccount` or `sa` in short:

## Finding the secret

.exercise[

- List the secrets for the `default` service account:
  ```bash
  kubectl get sa default -o yaml
  SECRET=$(kubectl get sa default -o json | jq -r .secrets[0].name)
  ```

]

It should be named `default-token-XXXXX`.

---

class: extra-details

## Extracting the token

- The token is stored in the secret, wrapped with base64 encoding

.exercise[

- View the secret:
  ```bash
  kubectl get secret $SECRET -o yaml
  ```

- Extract the token and decode it:
  ```bash
  TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret $SECRET -o json \
          | jq -r .data.token | openssl base64 -d -A)
  ```

## Using the token

- Let's send a request to the API, without and with the token

.exercise[

- Find the ClusterIP for the `kubernetes` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc kubernetes
  API=$(kubectl get svc kubernetes -o json | jq -r .spec.clusterIP)
  ```

- Connect without the token:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://$API
  ```

- Connect with the token:
  ```bash
  curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://$API
  ```

## Results

- In both cases, we will get a "Forbidden" error

- Without authentication, the user is `system:anonymous`

- With authentication, it is shown as `system:serviceaccount:default:default`

- The API "sees" us as a different user

- But neither user has any right, so we can't do nothin'

- Let's change that!

---

## Authorization in Kubernetes

- There are multiple ways to grant permissions in Kubernetes, called [authorizers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#authorization-modules):

  - [Node Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/node/) (used internally by kubelet; we can ignore it)

  - [Attribute-based access control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/abac/) (powerful but complex and static; ignore it too)

  - [Webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/) (each API request is submitted to an external service for approval)

  - [Role-based access control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) (associates permissions to users dynamically)

- The one we want is the last one, generally abbreviated as RBAC

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Role-based access control

- RBAC allows to specify fine-grained permissions

- Permissions are expressed as *rules*

- A rule is a combination of:

  - [verbs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#determine-the-request-verb) like create, get, list, update, delete ...

  - resources (as in "API resource", like pods, nodes, services ...)

  - resource names (to specify e.g. one specific pod instead of all pods)

  - in some case, [subresources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#referring-to-resources) (e.g. logs are subresources of pods)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## From rules to roles to rolebindings

- A *role* is an API object containing a list of *rules*

  Example: role "external-load-balancer-configurator" can:
  - [list, get] resources [endpoints, services, pods]
  - [update] resources [services]

- A *rolebinding* associates a role with a user

  Example: rolebinding "external-load-balancer-configurator":
  - associates user "external-load-balancer-configurator"
  - with role "external-load-balancer-configurator"

- Yes, there can be users, roles, and rolebindings with the same name

- It's a good idea for 1-1-1 bindings; not so much for 1-N ones

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Cluster-scope permissions

- API resources Role and RoleBinding are for objects within a namespace

- We can also define API resources ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding

- These are a superset, allowing to:

  - specify actions on cluster-wide objects (like nodes)

  - operate across all namespaces

- We can create Role and RoleBinding resources within a namespaces

- ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding resources are global

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Pods and service accounts

- A pod can be associated to a service account

  - by default, it is associated to the `default` service account

  - as we've seen earlier, this service account has no permission anyway

- The associated token is exposed into the pod's filesystem

  (in `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`)

- Standard Kubernetes tooling (like `kubectl`) will look for it there

- So Kubernetes tools running in a pod will automatically use the service account

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## In practice

- We are going to create a service account

- We will use a default cluster role (`view`)

- We will bind together this role and this service account

- Then we will run a pod using that service account

- In this pod, we will install `kubectl` and check our permissions

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Creating a service account

- We will call the new service account `viewer`

  (note that nothing prevents us from calling it `view`, like the role)

.exercise[

- Create the new service account:
  ```bash
  kubectl create serviceaccount viewer
  ```

- List service accounts now:
  ```bash
  kubectl get serviceaccounts
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Binding a role to the service account

- Binding a role = creating a *rolebinding* object

- We will call that object `viewercanview`

  (but again, we could call it `view`)

.exercise[

- Create the new role binding:
  ```bash
  kubectl create rolebinding viewercanview \
          --clusterrole=view \
          --serviceaccount=default:viewer
  ```

]

It's important to note a couple of details in these flags ...

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Roles vs Cluster Roles

- We used `--clusterrole=view`

- What would have happened if we had used `--role=view`?

  - we would have bound the role `view` from the local namespace
    <br/>(instead of the cluster role `view`)

  - the command would have worked fine (no error)

  - but later, our API requests would have been denied

- This is a deliberate design decision

  (we can reference roles that don't exist, and create/update them later)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Users vs Service Accounts

- We used `--serviceaccount=default:viewer`

- What would have happened if we had used `--user=default:viewer`?

  - we would have bound the role to a user instead of a service account

  - again, the command would have worked fine (no error)

  - ... but our API requests would have been denied later

- What's about the `default:` prefix?

  - that's the namespace of the service account

  - yes, it could be inferred from context, but ... `kubectl` requires it

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Testing

- We will run an `alpine` pod and install `kubectl` there

.exercise[

- Run a one-time pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl run eyepod --rm -ti --restart=Never \
          --serviceaccount=viewer \
          --image alpine
  ```

- Install `curl`, then use it to install `kubectl`:
  ```bash
  apk add --no-cache curl
  URLBASE=https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release
  KUBEVER=$(curl -s $URLBASE/stable.txt)
  curl -LO $URLBASE/$KUBEVER/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
  chmod +x kubectl
  ```

---

## Running `kubectl` in the pod

- We'll try to use our `view` permissions, then to create an object

.exercise[

- Check that we can, indeed, view things:
  ```bash
  ./kubectl get all
  ```

- But that we can't create things:
  ```
  ./kubectl create deployment testrbac --image=nginx
  ```

- Exit the container with `exit` or `^D`

<!-- ```keys ^D``` -->

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Testing directly with `kubectl`

- We can also check for permission with `kubectl auth can-i`:
  ```bash
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes
  kubectl auth can-i create pods
  kubectl auth can-i get pod/name-of-pod
  kubectl auth can-i get /url-fragment-of-api-request/
  kubectl auth can-i '*' services
  ```

- And we can check permissions on behalf of other users:
  ```bash
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes \
          --as some-user
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes \
          --as system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<name-of-service-account>
  ```

## Where does this `view` role come from?

- Kubernetes defines a number of ClusterRoles intended to be bound to users

- `cluster-admin` can do *everything* (think `root` on UNIX)

- `admin` can do *almost everything* (except e.g. changing resource quotas and limits)

- `edit` is similar to `admin`, but cannot view or edit permissions

- `view` has read-only access to most resources, except permissions and secrets

*In many situations, these roles will be all you need.*

*You can also customize them if needed!*

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Customizing the default roles

- If you need to *add* permissions to these default roles (or others),
  <br/>
  you can do it through the [ClusterRole Aggregation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles) mechanism

- This happens by creating a ClusterRole with the following labels:
  ```yaml
    metadata:
      labels:
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true"
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: "true"
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true"
  ```

- This ClusterRole permissions will be added to `admin`/`edit`/`view` respectively

- This is particulary useful when using CustomResourceDefinitions

  (since Kubernetes cannot guess which resources are sensitive and which ones aren't)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Where do our permissions come from?

- When interacting with the Kubernetes API, we are using a client certificate

- We saw previously that this client certificate contained:

  `CN=kubernetes-admin` and `O=system:masters`

- Let's look for these in existing ClusterRoleBindings:
  ```bash
  kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o yaml | 
    grep -e kubernetes-admin -e system:masters
  ```

  (`system:masters` should show up, but not `kubernetes-admin`.)

- Where does this match come from?

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The `system:masters` group

- If we eyeball the output of `kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o yaml`, we'll find out!

- It is in the `cluster-admin` binding:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe clusterrolebinding cluster-admin
  ```

- This binding associates `system:masters` to the cluster role `cluster-admin`

- And the `cluster-admin` is, basically, `root`:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe clusterrole cluster-admin
  ```

## Figuring out who can do what

- For auditing purposes, sometimes we want to know who can perform an action

- Here is a proof-of-concept tool by Aqua Security, doing exactly that:

  https://github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can

- This is one way to install it:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/go/bin golang \
         go get -v github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can
  ```

- This is one way to use it:
  ```bash
  kubectl-who-can create pods
  ```

# Exposing HTTP services with Ingress resources

- *Services* give us a way to access a pod or a set of pods

- Services can be exposed to the outside world:

  - with type `NodePort` (on a port >30000)

  - with type `LoadBalancer` (allocating an external load balancer)

- What about HTTP services?

  - how can we expose `webui`, `rng`, `hasher`?

  - the Kubernetes dashboard?

  - a new version of `webui`?

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Exposing HTTP services

- If we use `NodePort` services, clients have to specify port numbers

  (i.e. http://xxxxx:31234 instead of just http://xxxxx)

- `LoadBalancer` services are nice, but:

  - they are not available in all environments

  - they often carry an additional cost (e.g. they provision an ELB)

  - they require one extra step for DNS integration
    <br/>
    (waiting for the `LoadBalancer` to be provisioned; then adding it to DNS)

- We could build our own reverse proxy

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Building a custom reverse proxy

- There are many options available:

  Apache, HAProxy, Hipache, NGINX, Traefik, ...

  (look at [jpetazzo/aiguillage](https://github.com/jpetazzo/aiguillage) for a minimal reverse proxy configuration using NGINX)

- Most of these options require us to update/edit configuration files after each change

- Some of them can pick up virtual hosts and backends from a configuration store

- Wouldn't it be nice if this configuration could be managed with the Kubernetes API?

--

- Enter.red[¹] *Ingress* resources!

.footnote[.red[¹] Pun maybe intended.]

---

## Ingress resources

- Kubernetes API resource (`kubectl get ingress`/`ingresses`/`ing`)

- Designed to expose HTTP services

- Basic features:

  - load balancing
  - SSL termination
  - name-based virtual hosting

- Can also route to different services depending on:

  - URI path (e.g. `/api`→`api-service`, `/static`→`assets-service`)
  - Client headers, including cookies (for A/B testing, canary deployment...)
  - and more!

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Principle of operation

- Step 1: deploy an *ingress controller*

  - ingress controller = load balancer + control loop

  - the control loop watches over ingress resources, and configures the LB accordingly

- Step 2: setup DNS

  - associate DNS entries with the load balancer address

- Step 3: create *ingress resources*

  - the ingress controller picks up these resources and configures the LB

- Step 4: profit!

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Ingress in action

- We will deploy the Traefik ingress controller

  - this is an arbitrary choice

  - maybe motivated by the fact that Traefik releases are named after cheeses

- For DNS, we will use [nip.io](http://nip.io/)

  - `*.1.2.3.4.nip.io` resolves to `1.2.3.4`

- We will create ingress resources for various HTTP services

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Deploying pods listening on port 80

- We want our ingress load balancer to be available on port 80

- We could do that with a `LoadBalancer` service

  ... but it requires support from the underlying infrastructure

- We could use pods specifying `hostPort: 80` 

  ... but with most CNI plugins, this [doesn't work or require additional setup](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/23920)

- We could use a `NodePort` service

  ... but that requires [changing the `--service-node-port-range` flag in the API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/)

- Last resort: the `hostNetwork` mode

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Without `hostNetwork`

- Normally, each pod gets its own *network namespace*

  (sometimes called sandbox or network sandbox)

- An IP address is associated to the pod

- This IP address is routed/connected to the cluster network

- All containers of that pod are sharing that network namespace

  (and therefore using the same IP address)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## With `hostNetwork: true`

- No network namespace gets created

- The pod is using the network namespace of the host

- It "sees" (and can use) the interfaces (and IP addresses) of the host

- The pod can receive outside traffic directly, on any port

- Downside: with most network plugins, network policies won't work for that pod

  - most network policies work at the IP address level

  - filtering that pod = filtering traffic from the node

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Running Traefik

- The [Traefik documentation](https://docs.traefik.io/user-guide/kubernetes/#deploy-trfik-using-a-deployment-or-daemonset) tells us to pick between Deployment and Daemon Set

- We are going to use a Daemon Set so that each node can accept connections

- We will do two minor changes to the [YAML provided by Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik/blob/v1.7/examples/k8s/traefik-ds.yaml):

  - enable `hostNetwork`

  - add a *toleration* so that Traefik also runs on `node1`

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Taints and tolerations

- A *taint* is an attribute added to a node

- It prevents pods from running on the node

- ... Unless they have a matching *toleration*

- When deploying with `kubeadm`:

  - a taint is placed on the node dedicated to the control plane

  - the pods running the control plane have a matching toleration

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]

## Checking taints on our nodes

.exercise[

- Check our nodes specs:
  ```bash
  kubectl get node node1 -o json | jq .spec
  kubectl get node node2 -o json | jq .spec
  ```

]

We should see a result only for `node1` (the one with the control plane):

```json
  "taints": [
    {
      "effect": "NoSchedule",
      "key": "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
    }
  ]
```

---

class: extra-details

## Understanding a taint

- The `key` can be interpreted as:

  - a reservation for a special set of pods
    <br/>
    (here, this means "this node is reserved for the control plane")

  - an error condition on the node
    <br/>
    (for instance: "disk full", do not start new pods here!)

- The `effect` can be:

  - `NoSchedule` (don't run new pods here)

  - `PreferNoSchedule` (try not to run new pods here)

  - `NoExecute` (don't run new pods and evict running pods)

## Checking tolerations on the control plane

.exercise[

- Check tolerations for CoreDNS:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system get deployments coredns -o json |
          jq .spec.template.spec.tolerations
  ```

]

The result should include:
```json
  {
    "effect": "NoSchedule",
    "key": "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
  }
```

It means: "bypass the exact taint that we saw earlier on `node1`."

## Special tolerations

.exercise[

- Check tolerations on `kube-proxy`:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system get ds kube-proxy -o json | 
          jq .spec.template.spec.tolerations
  ```

]

The result should include:
```json
  {
    "operator": "Exists"
  }
```

This one is a special case that means "ignore all taints and run anyway."

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Running Traefik on our cluster

- We provide a YAML file (`k8s/traefik.yaml`) which is essentially the sum of:

  - [Traefik's Daemon Set resources](https://github.com/containous/traefik/blob/v1.7/examples/k8s/traefik-ds.yaml) (patched with `hostNetwork` and tolerations)

  - [Traefik's RBAC rules](https://github.com/containous/traefik/blob/v1.7/examples/k8s/traefik-rbac.yaml) allowing it to watch necessary API objects

.exercise[

- Apply the YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/kube.training/k8s/traefik.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Checking that Traefik runs correctly

- If Traefik started correctly, we now have a web server listening on each node

.exercise[

- Check that Traefik is serving 80/tcp:
  ```bash
  curl localhost
  ```

]

We should get a `404 page not found` error.

This is normal: we haven't provided any ingress rule yet.

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Setting up DNS

- To make our lives easier, we will use [nip.io](http://nip.io)

- Check out `http://cheddar.A.B.C.D.nip.io`

  (replacing A.B.C.D with the IP address of `node1`)

- We should get the same `404 page not found` error

  (meaning that our DNS is "set up properly", so to speak!)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Traefik web UI

- Traefik provides a web dashboard

- With the current install method, it's listening on port 8080

.exercise[

- Go to `http://node1:8080` (replacing `node1` with its IP address)

<!-- ```open http://node1:8080``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Setting up host-based routing ingress rules

- We are going to use `errm/cheese` images

  (there are [3 tags available](https://hub.docker.com/r/errm/cheese/tags/): wensleydale, cheddar, stilton)

- These images contain a simple static HTTP server sending a picture of cheese

- We will run 3 deployments (one for each cheese)

- We will create 3 services (one for each deployment)

- Then we will create 3 ingress rules (one for each service)

- We will route `<name-of-cheese>.A.B.C.D.nip.io` to the corresponding deployment

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Running cheesy web servers

.exercise[

- Run all three deployments:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment cheddar --image=errm/cheese:cheddar
  kubectl create deployment stilton --image=errm/cheese:stilton
  kubectl create deployment wensleydale --image=errm/cheese:wensleydale
  ```

- Create a service for each of them:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment cheddar --port=80
  kubectl expose deployment stilton --port=80
  kubectl expose deployment wensleydale --port=80
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]

## What does an ingress resource look like?

Here is a minimal host-based ingress resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cheddar
spec:
  rules:
  - host: cheddar.`A.B.C.D`.nip.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: cheddar
          servicePort: 80

```

(It is in `k8s/ingress.yaml`.)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Creating our first ingress resources

.exercise[

- Edit the file `~/container.training/k8s/ingress.yaml`

- Replace A.B.C.D with the IP address of `node1`

- Apply the file

- Open http://cheddar.A.B.C.D.nip.io

]

(An image of a piece of cheese should show up.)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Creating the other ingress resources

.exercise[

- Edit the file `~/container.training/k8s/ingress.yaml`

- Replace `cheddar` with `stilton` (in `name`, `host`, `serviceName`)

- Apply the file

- Check that `stilton.A.B.C.D.nip.io` works correctly

- Repeat for `wensleydale`

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Using multiple ingress controllers

- You can have multiple ingress controllers active simultaneously

  (e.g. Traefik and NGINX)

- You can even have multiple instances of the same controller

  (e.g. one for internal, another for external traffic)

- The `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation can be used to tell which one to use

- It's OK if multiple ingress controllers configure the same resource

  (it just means that the service will be accessible through multiple paths)

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Ingress: the good

- The traffic flows directly from the ingress load balancer to the backends

  - it doesn't need to go through the `ClusterIP`

  - in fact, we don't even need a `ClusterIP` (we can use a headless service)

- The load balancer can be outside of Kubernetes

  (as long as it has access to the cluster subnet)

- This allows to use external (hardware, physical machines...) load balancers

- Annotations can encode special features

  (rate-limiting, A/B testing, session stickiness, etc.) 

.debug[[k8s/ingress.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/ingress.md)]
---

## Ingress: the bad

- Aforementioned "special features" are not standardized yet

- Some controllers will support them; some won't

- Even relatively common features (stripping a path prefix) can differ:

  - [traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/rule-type: PathPrefixStrip](https://docs.traefik.io/user-guide/kubernetes/#path-based-routing)

  - [ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ingress/controllers/nginx/examples/rewrite)

- This should eventually stabilize

  (remember that ingresses are currently `apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1`)

# Git-based workflows

- Deploying with `kubectl` has downsides:

  - we don't know *who* deployed *what* and *when*

  - there is no audit trail (except the API server logs)

  - there is no easy way to undo most operations

  - there is no review/approval process (like for code reviews)

- We have all these things for *code*, though

- Can we manage cluster state like we manage our source code?

## Reminder: Kubernetes is *declarative*

- All we do is create/change resources

- These resources have a perfect YAML representation

- All we do is manipulating these YAML representations

  (`kubectl run` generates a YAML file that gets applied)

- We can store these YAML representations in a code repository

- We can version that code repository and maintain it with best practices

  - define which branch(es) can go to qa/staging/production

  - control who can push to which branches

  - have formal review processes, pull requests ...

- There are a few tools out there to help us do that

- We'll see demos of two of them: [Flux] and [Gitkube]

- Flux polls that repository regularly (every 5 minutes by default)

- The resources described by the YAML files are created/updated automatically

- Changes are made by updating the code in the repository

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Preparing a repository for Flux

- We need a repository with Kubernetes YAML files

- I have one: https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins

- Fork it to your GitHub account

- Create a new branch in your fork; e.g. `prod`

  (e.g. by adding a line in the README through the GitHub web UI)

- This is the branch that we are going to use for deployment

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Setting up Flux

- Clone the Flux repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/weaveworks/flux
  ```

- Edit `deploy/flux-deployment.yaml`

- Change the `--git-url` and `--git-branch` parameters:
  ```yaml
  - --git-url=git@github.com:your-git-username/kubercoins
  - --git-branch=prod
  ```

- Apply all the YAML:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f deploy/
  ```

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Allowing Flux to access the repository

- When it starts, Flux generates an SSH key

- Display that key:
  ```
  kubectl logs deployment/flux | grep identity
  ```

- Then add that key to the repository, giving it **write** access

  (some Flux features require write access)

- After a minute or so, DockerCoins will be deployed to the current namespace

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Making changes

- Make changes (on the `prod` branch), e.g. change `replicas` in `worker`

- After a few minutes, the changes will be picked up by Flux and applied

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Other features

- Flux can keep a list of all the tags of all the images we're running

- The `fluxctl` tool can show us if we're running the latest images

- We can also "automate" a resource (i.e. automatically deploy new images)

- And much more!

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Gitkube overview

- We put our Kubernetes resources as YAML files in a git repository

- Gitkube is a git server (or "git remote")

- After making changes to the repository, we push to Gitkube

- Gitkube applies the resources to the cluster

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Setting up Gitkube

- Install the CLI:
  ```
  sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/gitkube \
       https://github.com/hasura/gitkube/releases/download/v0.2.1/gitkube_linux_amd64
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gitkube
  ```

- Install Gitkube on the cluster:
  ```
  gitkube install --expose ClusterIP
  ```

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Creating a Remote

- Gitkube provides a new type of API resource: *Remote*

  (this is using a mechanism called Custom Resource Definitions or CRD)

- Create and apply a YAML file containing the following manifest:
  ```yaml
	apiVersion: gitkube.sh/v1alpha1
	kind: Remote
	metadata:
	  name: example
	spec:
	  authorizedKeys:
	  - `ssh-rsa AAA...`
	  manifests:
	    path: "."
  ```

  (replace the `ssh-rsa AAA...` section with the content of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`)

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Pushing to our remote

- Get the `gitkubed` IP address:
  ```
  kubectl -n kube-system get svc gitkubed
  IP=$(kubectl -n kube-system get svc gitkubed -o json | 
  	   jq -r .spec.clusterIP)
  ```

- Get ourselves a sample repository with resource YAML files:
  ```
  git clone git://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins
  cd kubercoins
  ```

- Add the remote and push to it:
  ```
  git remote add k8s ssh://default-example@$IP/~/git/default-example
  git push k8s master
  ```

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Making changes

- Edit a local file

- Commit

- Push!

- Make sure that you push to the `k8s` remote

.debug[[k8s/gitworkflows.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/gitworkflows.md)]
---

## Other features

- Gitkube can also build container images for us

  (see the [documentation](https://github.com/hasura/gitkube/blob/master/docs/remote.md) for more details)

- Gitkube can also deploy Helm Charts

  (instead of raw YAML files)

# Collecting metrics with Prometheus

- Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system including:

  - multiple *service discovery* backends to figure out which metrics to collect

  - a *scraper* to collect these metrics

  - an efficient *time series database* to store these metrics

  - a specific query language (PromQL) to query these time series

  - an *alert manager* to notify us according to metrics values or trends

- We are going to deploy it on our Kubernetes cluster and see how to query it

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Why Prometheus?

- We don't endorse Prometheus more or less than any other system

- It's relatively well integrated within the Cloud Native ecosystem

- It can be self-hosted (this is useful for tutorials like this)

- It can be used for deployments of varying complexity:

  - one binary and 10 lines of configuration to get started

  - all the way to thousands of nodes and millions of metrics

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Exposing metrics to Prometheus

- Prometheus obtains metrics and their values by querying *exporters*

- An exporter serves metrics over HTTP, in plain text

- This is what the *node exporter* looks like:

  http://demo.robustperception.io:9100/metrics

- Prometheus itself exposes its own internal metrics, too:

  http://demo.robustperception.io:9090/metrics

- If you want to expose custom metrics to Prometheus:

  - serve a text page like these, and you're good to go

  - libraries are available in various languages to help with quantiles etc.

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## How Prometheus gets these metrics

- The *Prometheus server* will *scrape* URLs like these at regular intervals

  (by default: every minute; can be more/less frequent)

- If you're worried about parsing overhead: exporters can also use protobuf

- The list of URLs to scrape (the *scrape targets*) is defined in configuration

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Defining scrape targets

This is maybe the simplest configuration file for Prometheus:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```

- In this configuration, Prometheus collects its own internal metrics

- A typical configuration file will have multiple `scrape_configs`

- In this configuration, the list of targets is fixed

- A typical configuration file will use dynamic service discovery

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Service discovery

This configuration file will leverage existing DNS `A` records:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - ...
  - job_name: 'node'
    dns_sd_configs:
      - names: ['api-backends.dc-paris-2.enix.io']
        type: 'A'
        port: 9100
```

- In this configuration, Prometheus resolves the provided name(s)

  (here, `api-backends.dc-paris-2.enix.io`)

- Each resulting IP address is added as a target on port 9100

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Dynamic service discovery

- In the DNS example, the names are re-resolved at regular intervals

- As DNS records are created/updated/removed, scrape targets change as well

- Existing data (previously collected metrics) is not deleted

- Other service discovery backends work in a similar fashion

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Other service discovery mechanisms

- Prometheus can connect to e.g. a cloud API to list instances

- Or to the Kubernetes API to list nodes, pods, services ...

- Or a service like Consul, Zookeeper, etcd, to list applications

- The resulting configurations files are *way more complex*

  (but don't worry, we won't need to write them ourselves)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Time series database

- We could wonder, "why do we need a specialized database?"

- One metrics data point = metrics ID + timestamp + value

- With a classic SQL or noSQL data store, that's at least 160 bits of data + indexes

- Prometheus is way more efficient, without sacrificing performance

  (it will even be gentler on the I/O subsystem since it needs to write less)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Running Prometheus on our cluster

We need to:

- Run the Prometheus server in a pod

  (using e.g. a Deployment to ensure that it keeps running)

- Expose the Prometheus server web UI (e.g. with a NodePort)

- Run the *node exporter* on each node (with a Daemon Set)

- Setup a Service Account so that Prometheus can query the Kubernetes API

- Configure the Prometheus server

  (storing the configuration in a Config Map for easy updates)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Helm Charts to the rescue

- To make our lives easier, we are going to use a Helm Chart

- The Helm Chart will take care of all the steps explained above

  (including some extra features that we don't need, but won't hurt)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Step 1: install Helm

- If we already installed Helm earlier, these commands won't break anything

.exercice[

- Install Tiller (Helm's server-side component) on our cluster:
  ```bash
  helm init
  ```

- Give Tiller permission to deploy things on our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl create clusterrolebinding add-on-cluster-admin \
      --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:default
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Step 2: install Prometheus

- Skip this if we already installed Prometheus earlier

  (in doubt, check with `helm list`)

.exercice[

- Install Prometheus on our cluster:
  ```bash
  helm install stable/prometheus \
         --set server.service.type=NodePort \
         --set server.persistentVolume.enabled=false
  ```

]

The provided flags:

- expose the server web UI (and API) on a NodePort

- use an ephemeral volume for metrics storage
  <br/>
  (instead of requesting a Persistent Volume through a Persistent Volume Claim)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Connecting to the Prometheus web UI

- Let's connect to the web UI and see what we can do

.exercise[

- Figure out the NodePort that was allocated to the Prometheus server:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc | grep prometheus-server
  ```

- With your browser, connect to that port

]

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Querying some metrics

- This is easy ... if you are familiar with PromQL

.exercise[

- Click on "Graph", and in "expression", paste the following:
  ```
    sum by (instance) (
      irate(
        container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{
          pod_name=~"worker.*"
          }[5m]
      )
    )
  ```

]

- Click on the blue "Execute" button and on the "Graph" tab just below

- We see the cumulated CPU usage of worker pods for each node
  <br/>
  (if we just deployed Prometheus, there won't be much data to see, though)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Getting started with PromQL

- We can't learn PromQL in just 5 minutes

- But we can cover the basics to get an idea of what is possible

  (and have some keywords and pointers)

- We are going to break down the query above

  (building it one step at a time)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Graphing one metric across all tags

This query will show us CPU usage across all containers:
```
container_cpu_usage_seconds_total
```

- The suffix of the metrics name tells us: 

  - the unit (seconds of CPU)

  - that it's the total used since the container creation

- Since it's a "total", it is an increasing quantity

  (we need to compute the derivative if we want e.g. CPU % over time)

- We see that the metrics retrieved have *tags* attached to them

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Selecting metrics with tags

This query will show us only metrics for worker containers:
```
container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod_name=~"worker.*"}
```

- The `=~` operator allows regex matching

- We select all the pods with a name starting with `worker`

  (it would be better to use labels to select pods; more on that later)

- The result is a smaller set of containers

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Transforming counters in rates

This query will show us CPU usage % instead of total seconds used:
```
100*irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod_name=~"worker.*"}[5m])
```

- The [`irate`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#irate) operator computes the "per-second instant rate of increase"

  - `rate` is similar but allows decreasing counters and negative values

  - with `irate`, if a counter goes back to zero, we don't get a negative spike

- The `[5m]` tells how far to look back if there is a gap in the data

- And we multiply with `100*` to get CPU % usage

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Aggregation operators

This query sums the CPU usage per node:
```
sum by (instance) (
  irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod_name=~"worker.*"}[5m])
)
```

- `instance` corresponds to the node on which the container is running

- `sum by (instance) (...)` computes the sum for each instance

- Note: all the other tags are collapsed

  (in other words, the resulting graph only shows the `instance` tag)

- PromQL supports many more [aggregation operators](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#aggregation-operators)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## What kind of metrics can we collect?

- Node metrics (related to physical or virtual machines)

- Container metrics (resource usage per container)

- Databases, message queues, load balancers, ...

  (check out this [list of exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/)!)

- Instrumentation (=deluxe `printf` for our code)

- Business metrics (customers served, revenue, ...)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Node metrics

- CPU, RAM, disk usage on the whole node

- Total number of processes running, and their states

- Number of open files, sockets, and their states

- I/O activity (disk, network), per operation or volume

- Physical/hardware (when applicable): temperature, fan speed ...

- ... and much more!

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Container metrics

- Similar to node metrics, but not totally identical

- RAM breakdown will be different

  - active vs inactive memory
  - some memory is *shared* between containers, and accounted specially

- I/O activity is also harder to track

  - async writes can cause deferred "charges"
  - some page-ins are also shared between containers

For details about container metrics, see:

---

class: extra-details

## Application metrics

- Arbitrary metrics related to your application and business

- System performance: request latency, error rate ...

- Volume information: number of rows in database, message queue size ...

- Business data: inventory, items sold, revenue ...

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Detecting scrape targets

- Prometheus can leverage Kubernetes service discovery

  (with proper configuration)

- Services or pods can be annotated with:

  - `prometheus.io/scrape: true` to enable scraping
  - `prometheus.io/port: 9090` to indicate the port number
  - `prometheus.io/path: /metrics` to indicate the URI (`/metrics` by default)

- Prometheus will detect and scrape these (without needing a restart or reload)

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Querying labels

- What if we want to get metrics for containers belong to pod tagged `worker`?

- The cAdvisor exporter does not give us Kubernetes labels

- Kubernetes labels are exposed through another exporter

- We can see Kubernetes labels through metrics `kube_pod_labels`

  (each container appears as a time series with constant value of `1`)

- Prometheus *kind of* supports "joins" between time series

- But only if the names of the tags match exactly

.debug[[k8s/prometheus.md](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training.git/tree/k8s_metropole_de_lyon/slides/k8s/prometheus.md)]
---

## Unfortunately ...

- The cAdvisor exporter uses tag `pod_name` for the name of a pod

- The Kubernetes service endpoints exporter uses tag `pod` instead

- See [this blog post](https://www.robustperception.io/exposing-the-software-version-to-prometheus) or [this other one](https://www.weave.works/blog/aggregating-pod-resource-cpu-memory-usage-arbitrary-labels-prometheus/) to see how to perform "joins"

- Alas, Prometheus cannot "join" time series with different labels

  (see [Prometheus issue #2204](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/2204) for the rationale)

- There is a workaround involving relabeling, but it's "not cheap"

  - see [this comment](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/2204#issuecomment-261515520) for an overview

  - or [this blog post](https://5pi.de/2017/11/09/use-prometheus-vector-matching-to-get-kubernetes-utilization-across-any-pod-label/) for a complete description of the process
