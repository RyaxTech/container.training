# Setting up Kubernetes

- How did we set up these Kubernetes clusters that we're using?

--

- We used `kubeadm` on freshly installed VM instances running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

    1. Install Docker

    2. Install Kubernetes packages

    3. Run `kubeadm init` on the master node

    4. Set up Weave (the overlay network)
       <br/>
       (that step is just one `kubectl apply` command; discussed later)

    5. Run `kubeadm join` on the other nodes (with the token produced by `kubeadm init`)

    6. Copy the configuration file generated by `kubeadm init`

- Check the [prepare VMs README](https://github.com/RyaxTech/kube.training/blob/master/prepare-vms/README.md) for more dedtails

---

## `kubeadm` drawbacks

- Doesn't set up Docker or any other container engine

- Doesn't set up the overlay network

- Doesn't set up multi-master (no high availability)

  (At least ... not yet!)

## Other deployment options

- If you are on Azure:
  [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-service/)

- If you are on Google Cloud:
  [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)

- If you are on AWS:
  [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
  or
  [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)

- On a local machine:
  [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/),
  [kubespawn](https://github.com/kinvolk/kube-spawn),
  [Docker4Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/kubernetes/)

- If you want something customizable:
  [kubicorn](https://github.com/kubicorn/kubicorn)

  Probably the closest to a multi-cloud/hybrid solution so far, but in development

---

## Even more deployment options

- If you like Ansible:
  [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray)

- If you like Terraform:
  [typhoon](https://github.com/poseidon/typhoon/)

- You can also learn how to install every component manually, with
  the excellent tutorial [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)

  *Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.*

- There are also many commercial options available!

- For a longer list, check the Kubernetes documentation:
  <br/>
  it has a great guide to [pick the right solution](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/) to set up Kubernetes.

## Installation with Kubeadm

- We are not going to perform the installation of Kubernetes.

- The following slides show us how to do it with Kubeadm (you can do it on your own after the training).

---

## Installation with Kubeadm


.exercise[

- Installation of Docker packages, if they are not installed, on all nodes of the cluster:
  ```bash
    sudo su
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    add-apt-repository "deb https://download.docker.com/linux/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$ID") $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-compose
    exit
    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  ```
]

## Installation with Kubeadm 


.exercise[

- Installation of Kubernetes packages if they are not installed on every node of the cluster:
  ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https curl
    curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo su
    cat <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
    deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
    EOF
    exit
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   ```
]

---

## Installation with Kubeadm

.exercise[

- Configuration of Kubernetes with Kubeadm on the first node of the cluster:
  ```bash
    sudo kubeadm init 
    sudo mkdir -p $HOME/.kube /home/docker/.kube
    sudo cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
    sudo cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf /home/docker/.kube/config
    sudo chown -R $(id -u) $HOME/.kube
    kubever=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')
    kubectl apply -f https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$kubever
  ```

- Configuration of Kubernetes on the other nodes of the cluster:
- Connect on each compute node and apply the last command returned at the end of the `kubeadm init` command launched on the master node
- Test if the nodes are correctly configured by returning on the master node and executing:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
